Photograph recovered from SCP-4450-\u03b1 during Incident 4261990-4450.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4450\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Appearances of SCP-4450-\u03b1 and/or SCP-4450-\u03b2 are to be immediately reported to the Site Director, alongside any on-site O5 council-members. SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 are to be asked to await their arrival. Any requests for readily available sums of money made by SCP-4450-\u03b1 or SCP-4450-\u03b2 during this time are to be granted.\n\n\nOnce the Site Director or any member of the O5 council arrives at the location of SCP-4450-\u03b1 or -\u03b2, they are to be considered the Point of Contact until SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 demanifest. All personnel are to divert any further requests to the Point of Contact.\n\n\nInvestigation into the method of accessing SCP-4450-1 is to continue until entry is successfully achieved.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 are Caucasian males always observed wearing black and grey suits, respectively. SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 refer to one another as brothers, and often address each other by name, with SCP-4450-\u03b1 being called \"Chris\", and SCP-4450-\u03b2 being called \"Beryl\".\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 both speak in a very informal style often couched in thinly-veiled threats. These threats often revolve around property damage and the scale of the threats increases based on the number of missed payments. The only known method of preventing this destructive behavior is through the offer of sufficient payment of physical currency\n1\n, after which SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 behave significantly more cordially for a time (approximately 6 months).\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 claim to be agents of an unspecified employer, and express desire to collect payment for property damage suffered by their employer. When questioned on the nature of the property damage, SCP-4450-\u03b1 described a nuclear attack upon a structure resembling an extraplanar pocket dimension, designated SCP-4450-1. Further details regarding the nature of SCP-4450-1 as well as methods of accessing SCP-4450-1 are still being investigated.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 have displayed a number of anomalous properties, including:\n2\n\n\n\n\ncapability of spontaneously manifesting in any location.\n3\n\n\ncapability of spontaneously demanifesting from any location.\n\n\nspeed, strength, and durability far beyond human maxima.\n\n\nprolonged, high-speed flight.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1: Point of Contact 4450 documentation\n\n\n\n\nPoint\u00a0of\u00a0Contact\u00a0Login\n\n\n\n\nLogout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints of Contact are authorized to withdraw up to 95% of on-site currency reserves in order to pay SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. In the event that this sum is deemed insufficient, no attempts to bargain are to be made. They are to be asked to wait until funds and assets are consolidated from other Foundation facilities.\n\n\nOnce SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 express satisfaction with the offered payment, they, along with the offered physical payment, will simultaneously vanish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2: Incident 4261990-4450\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a04261990-4450\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a02:\u00a0Incident\u00a04261990-4450\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 4261990-4450 Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 04/26/1990\n\n\nResponse Team:\n MTF Omega-7 (\"Pandora's Box\")\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n \u03a9-7 Wilbur\n\n\nTeam Members:\n \u03a9-7 Lucy / \u03a9-7 Dandelion / \u03a9-7 Hayes / SCP-076-2 \"Subject Able\"\n\n\nForeword:\n MTF Omega-7 responding to subdue destructive entities at 37.524\u2588\u2588\u2588, -89.386\u2588\u2588\u2588\n4\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nFeed shows \u03a9-7 Wilbur, \u03a9-7 Lucy, \u03a9-7 Dandelion, \u03a9-7 Hayes, and Subject Able sitting within \u03a9-7 taskforce dropship. Subject Able is motionless with its eyes closed and head bowed.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n We're landing. Standby to move out.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Hayes:\n What do we know about the anomaly?\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n Practically fuck all. All the GOC sent with their SOS was that there are two of them, and that they blew away most of their compound.\n\n\nSubject Able shows signs of unrest. Dropship interior shakes and rear exit hatch opens. Field of view moves with \u03a9-7 Wilbur.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n Let's move, people! Keep your eyes peeled for hostiles.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Lucy:\n Jesus fuck, they really did a number on the building.\n\n\nView shifts to show an extensive field of concrete and metal rubble. 4 crashed assault helicopters and 13 dead Global Occult Coalition personnel are visible within the debris.\n\n\nSubject Able:\n (\nYelling\n) Why are you hiding up there, [Sumerian word, untranslated] cowards?\n\n\nCamera moves to take in Subject Able, who is looking towards the sky. View moves upwards to show SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 levitating roughly 30m above the ground. Several seconds pass, during which Subject Able can be heard growling, before SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 vanish and reappear on the ground roughly 20m from \u03a9-7 Wilbur.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Dandelion:\n Careful. Looks like they can teleport.\n\n\nSubject Able:\n That wasn't teleport. Fast movement. Stay back, this will be fun for me.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 begin walking towards Subject Able.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1:\n Oi, are you lads here to pay for the damages? They said they was sendin' for someone, but we got tired of waiting. You lads should know how it is, accidents 'appen.\n\n\nSubject Able leaps forward, manifesting a 2m long sword and swinging it down towards SCP-4450-\u03b1. SCP-4450-\u03b1's left arm repositions between frames and intercepts Subject Able's attack. Despite fully halting the swing, SCP-4450-\u03b1 displays no signs of physical exertion.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b2:\n You lads trying to start somethin' while we're just trying to collect an honest debt here? Now that's just a shame, innit, Chris?\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1:\n Terrible shame, Beryl. Trying to get out of paying like that.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 clenches its fist, shattering Subject Able's weapon. Subject Able manifests a pair of 1m long swords towards SCP-4450-\u03b1. SCP-4450-\u03b1 similarly repositions both of its arms to intercept the attacks.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b2:\n You'd best watch out, mate. My brother gets upset when people try dodgin' their debt. Things tend to break when people get upset, don't they Chris?\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1:\n That's right Beryl, that's right. Shame how people never learn their lesson.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1's left hand strikes through Subject Able's left arm, severing the extremity above the elbow. Subject Able stabs towards SCP-4450-\u03b1 with the blade in its right hand. SCP-4450-\u03b1's right hand punches the blade, shattering the weapon and crushing Subject Able's right arm.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n Able! Withdraw! Omega-7, give him some covering fire!\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur, \u03a9-7 Lucy, \u03a9-7 Dandelion, and \u03a9-7 Hayes open fire on SCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. No damage is present on SCP-4450-\u03b1 or -\u03b2.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Hayes:\n What the hell? Why aren't they going down?\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 delivers a blow through Subject Able's midsection, then kicks it aside. Subject Able collapses and attempts to rise, displaying symptoms of acute shock. SCP-4450-\u03b2 walks towards \u03a9-7 Wilbur.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b2:\n Well this is a lovely little group you've got here, captain. Surely you'd be very troubled if something happened to it.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 disappears from frame. \u03a9-7 Lucy screams briefly. Camera turns to show \u03a9-7 Lucy lying on the ground and bleeding from a wound to the lower back.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b2:\n Well, looks like my brother's being clumsy captain. You might want to figure out where to get us our money, captain.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur faces SCP-4450-\u03b2.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n Look, if it's money you're after, I'm certain my employers can offer the funds you need! Just let us get in contact with them.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Dandelion screams, falling forward into frame.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n Stop, goddamn it!\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b2:\n We're tired of waiting, Captain. Our employer sent us here to get his money, so we ain't gonna stop 'till we've got it.\n\n\n\u03a9-7 Wilbur:\n B\u2014 We don't have any with us, I\u2014 Look, take our dropship! It's worth a few hundred million, easy!\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 exchange quizzical glances. SCP-4450-\u03b2 shrugs and nods.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1:\n It's a little light, but I guess it'll do for now. Hurry on back to yer bosses, we'll be back soon.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1 walks back towards the collapsed Subject Able, who is still attempting to stand, and withdraws a photograph from within its suit, dropping it on Subject Able.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1:\n Here's somethin' to remember us by, soldier. Come see us when we get back, if you've managed to get yourself pulled back together.\n\n\nSCP-4450-\u03b1, -\u03b2, board Dropship \u03a9-7. SCP-4450-\u03b1 can be seen uttering something. SCP-4450-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and Dropship \u03a9-7 dematerialize.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3: Further Information\n\n\n\n\nRAISA collation of relevant information is still ongoing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. or goods of roughly equivalent value\n\n\n2\n.
