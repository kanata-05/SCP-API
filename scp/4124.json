    "all_text": "rating:\u00a0\n+45\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4124\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-4124 is to be kept in a storage locker at Site-22, and access is to be limited to Level 3 security personnel wearing Class B protective gloves and SCRAMBLE gear.\n\n\nOn-Site personnel are to report any sudden unprofessional relations among staff members. If a relationship is discovered, one of the two involved parties will then be relocated to another Site, depending on location in the chain of command.\n\n\nThe surviving staff member of an uncontained 4124-A event is to be administered Class-A amnestics, and assigned to a staff psychologist for counseling and monitored for suicidal tendencies. The corpse of the other staff member is to be disposed of according to standard procedures.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4124 is a small metal figurine in the shape of two children embracing, which stands on a rectangular base. The figure is approximately 24\u00a0cm tall, with a 6\u00a0cm wide and 5\u00a0cm long base. The figure appears to be constructed from platinum.\n1\n The following is engraved on the base in Latin: \"amicitia caduca est\". This roughly translates to: \"Friendship is fleeting\".\n\n\nSCP-4124-1 appears to be a male humanoid, approximately 1.8 M tall, carrying a backpack and dressed in a motorcycle helmet with a tinted visor, a bomber jacket, and blue jeans. They bear a blue star shaped tattoo on their neck. SCP-4124-1 has an unnaturally high-pitched voice, falling outside of possible human range.\n\n\nThe effects of SCP-4124 are threefold. Following exposure of a subject to SCP-4124 through direct touch, or prolonged visual contact, a period of 1-18 hours will follow in which the subject will develop a friendship with the first person they had prolonged verbal, visual, or physical contact with following exposure (Hereafter referred to as \"SCP-4124-2\" and \"SCP-4124-3\"). This friendship will appear to happen naturally, but is hypothesized to be the result of SCP-4124 influencing probability in the nearby environment. Over the following seven weeks, this friendship will strengthen, to the point where SCP-4124-2 and SCP-4124-3 consider themselves \"best friends\", and often confide in each other.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the eighth week, or soon after, an 4124-A event will occur. During an 4124-A event, SCP-4124-2 and SCP-4124-3 will suddenly begin to argue about a current issue, of which they are on opposite sides, commonly religion, politics, or a mistake one of them recently made. This argument will eventually escalate to the point of lethal violence, resulting in one instance murdering the other in self-defense, often in gruesome manner.\n\n\nUpon death of SCP-4124-2 or SCP-4124-3, SCP-4124 will manifest SCP-4124-1 within a 10 M radius of itself. Following manifestation, SCP-4124-1 will then approach the survivor. SCP-4124-1 has proven extremely agile, strong, and fast, and has never been successfully subdued. Depending on the distance between SCP-4124 and the subject, it may take up to fifteen minutes for SCP-4124-1 to reach them.\n\n\nWhen SCP-4124-1 reaches the subject, it will produce a \"friendship bracelet\" from its left breast pocket. These bracelets usually are metal bands, and always feature the name of the now deceased target embossed on them. SCP-4124-1 will then hold down the subject, and force the bracelet onto their left wrist. Following this, SCP-4124-1 will vocalize the phrase \"Best Friends Forever\" once, before demanifestation.\n\n\nThe bracelets have proven impossible to remove without amputation. Whenever the survivor looks at the bracelet, they will experience flashbacks, and often begin crying. Amnesticizing the survivor has proven partially successful, making the flashbacks less vivid. There is no complete cure for these effects. These effects often lead to withdrawal from others, distrust, and eventually, suicidal tendencies.\n\n\nA subject who has previously undergone SCP-4124's effects can not experience them again. However, there is no known limit to the amount of people SCP-4124 can effect at one time.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n [ Dr. Beiderman]\n\n\nInterviewer:\n [ Senior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]\n\n\nForeword:\n [This interview takes place following 4124-A Event 17]\n\n\n<Begin Log, 8:26\u00a0A:M \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588>\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n State your name for the record please.\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n Dr. Klaus Beiderman.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What were you doing when the 4124-A event occured?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n I was in the secure storage area, cataloging some new Mekhanite texts. I had just locked them back up when it started.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What did you observe?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman\n Somebody across the room from me raised her voice. I assumed she had dropped an artifact, so I ran over to see if I could help. I turned the corner, and it was \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, yelling at Agent Moorehead.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Do you recall the subject of the argument?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n From what I could tell, Agent Moorehead had misfiled something.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you, please continue.\n\n\nDr. Beiderman\n So they two of them got louder and louder, and I realized that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was reaching into their pocket for something.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What was the object?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman\n An X-ACTO Knife. Everything happened so fast. Agent Moorehead drew his gun and shot at her. She jumped on top of Agent Moorehead, and pulled the knife out, jabbing it into Moorehead's neck. And she kept doing it, over and over.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n At what point did SCP-4124-1 appear?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n It couldn\u2019t have been more than two minutes after Agent Moorehead expired.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Describe the entity, please.\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n It looked like a normal person by all accounts, with the exception of their face.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n What was wrong with their face? And how did you see their face?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n After it vocalized, it turned towards me and lifted its visor before disapparating.\n\n\nDr. Beiderman is silent for approximately 1 minute.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Doctor?\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n Oh, sorry. I'm trying to figure out how to put it in words.\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n It was an indescribable thing really. Have you ever lost something precious, and looked in the mirror afterwards? You've probably never thought to. This thing's face was contorted into such an expression of loss and pain, it was practically a caricature of the emotion. You could tell that wasn't how it actually felt though. It was clearly insane.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you. Look, I'm sorry you went through all this.\n\n\nDr. Beiderman:\n No, thank you. It helps to have someone to talk to.\n\n\nSenior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Let's wrap this up then. I'll buy you a drink from the machine down the hall.\n\n\n<End Log, 8:47\u00a0A.M.>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Following review of the tapes, it was determined that viewing SCP-4124-1's face yields similar properties to long term viewing of SCP-4124, at an extremely accelerated rate. \nThe remains of\n Dr. Beiderman \nwere\n was transferred to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4124 was created by POI-14WA5, an Anartist based in the African region of [REDACTED], along with many other POIs. SCP-4124 was discovered during a raid performed by MTF Kappa-29 \"Killjoys\" on Compound-12, a known anartist meeting place, where an \"art show\" was in progress. A transcript of the raid can be found in file [DATA EXPUNGED], and an interview with a surviving member of the MTF conducting the raid can be found [DATA EXPUNGED]. Records found at Compound-12 indicate that SCP-4124-1 depicts a former member of POI-14WA5's circle of friends, designated POI-14WC6. POI-14WC6 disappeared following a raid of a prior show by the Global Occult Coalition. POI-14WA5 was \"inspired\" to make SCP-4124 following this raid. The note-card that was found with SCP-4124 during the raid describes it as a piece on \"The futility of friendship\".\n\n\nPOI-14WC6 appears to be missing from his home in [REDACTED] and is wanted for questioning.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Welcome\u00a0Site\u00a0Director\n\n\n\n\nTo the Current Director.\n\nA disinformation protocol has been put into use for the containment of this anomaly. In particular, the ability of the foundation to ensure the survival of both parties is a blatant lie.\n\n\nWe did try. But, as mentioned in the main file, this anomaly manipulates probability. Transportation vehicles would experience breakdowns. Mistakes in scheduling would occur. In one case, the pilot of a priority one airlift had a heart attack. In other words, the only way to help people is to keep it out of sight in the first place.\n\n\nOf course, this would cause panic when, inevitably, someone would come under the effects of this SCP. It's human nature to try to do something. We can't accept the death of someone else, even when it's inevitable. In the end, the attempts to save those affected became more expensive than replacing the personnel. So we let the anomaly take its course, incinerate the bodies, and fill out paperwork for \"transfer to another site\".\n\n\nMason Strom, Site 22 Director of Security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Due to the effects of the SCP, studying its components thoroughly is considered an unnecessary risk to staff who have not experienced its effects, and staff who have experienced its effects refuse to touch the damn thing. -Senior Researcher D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4123\n | SCP-4124 | \nSCP-4125\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4124\n\" by Nathan Erickson, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
