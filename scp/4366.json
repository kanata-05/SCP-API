A field of exclusion, disguised as a strict No-Hunting nature reserve, has been set up surrounding the Elli\u00f0a\u00e1rdalur valley.\n\n\nAny large, shining objects are to be kept away from these forests due to the risk of SCP-4366 instances taking them away.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4366 are a species of large avian organisms believed to be one of the few species ever recorded to have developed \nantimemetic camouflage\n1\n as a way to ward off predators, giving the species a better chance at survival. However, this perceptual camouflage goes away upon expiration of the organism. The species is native and endemic to the forests of the Elli\u00f0a\u00e1rdalur valley in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.\n\n\nSCP-4366 is currently the largest flying species on record and is believed to have been around since the Pleistocene epoch\n2\n. SCP-4366 organisms range from black to dark brown in coloration, have a wingspan of over 6.8 to 7.2 meters, and weighs 98 to 127\u00a0kg. The species has a pseudo beak and six eyes with three on each side of the head. SCP-4366 lacks the need to eat, drink, or sleep, but breathe through gills located on the underside of the wings which are capable of diffusing sound; presumably to decrease chances of getting caught by predators. They are capable of taking in Nitrogen from the atmosphere and converting it into Oxygen as a waste product.\n\n\nSCP-4366 are capable of vocalization. Sounds made from SCP-4366 organisms are made at a higher frequency than humans are capable of hearing and have no anomalous properties.\n3\n Vocalizations are described as high-pitched \"purring\" and clicking noises which seem to indicate a form of communication between other SCP-4366 instances. SCP-4366 have also been known to take large objects that reflect light. The reason for this is unknown\n4\n.\n\n\nAddendum 4366.01:\n Memo regarding SCP-4366's biology\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0File_4366.01\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=Warning: Top Secret=\n\n\nFoundation Site-98/4366 Confidential\n\n\nThe following information below is exclusive to those working under the operation of the Department of Extradimensional Anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.2:\n Microscopic analysis of SCP-4366's cells taken from the expired subject (pictured above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4366 is one of the few species alive and known to us today that have developed strong antimemetic camouflage as an adaptation against predators. What we don't know is why their vitals are all wrong: Their anatomical structure, biochemical processes, and physiology are all wrong. Working alongside Dr. Phoenix, we discovered that SCP-4366 shares the same DNA sequence with birds; specifically, Corvus corax varius: The Icelandic Raven. None of it makes much sense, why would they share the same DNA match but look radically different?\n\n\n \n\n\nThe answer is simple: They're not from our Earth.\n\n\n \n\n\nNo, no, they're not extraterrestrial. Instead, they originate from a higher echelon of existence.\n\n\n \n\n\nLet me explain: The subatomic particles that make up our universe vibrate at a certain speed. We call this \"Dimensional Frequency\" as the higher the frequency or vibration, the higher up the particles are in dimension. The cellular structure of SCP-4366 vibrates much, much higher than our baseline frequency. If you were to make matter from our universe vibrate at this speed, the object would slowly cease to exist at the subatomic level.\n\n\n \n\n\nBut the same process doesn't occur here. No cellular degeneration. This matter is specialized to vibrate at this speed, as does all matter in our world in our dimension.\n\n\n \n\n\nBut this only raises more questions\u2026 how did these things get here in the first place? Matter with a lower dimensional constant shouldn't be able to perceive entities of higher dimensions and vice-versa. It's impossible. Hell, it \nshould\n be impossible.\n\n\n \n\n\nI'm going to submit a formal request to take in the project. It's fascinating, but even as it exists, this is pretty anomalous even for a regular anomaly.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n- Dr. MacWarren, Department Head\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4366.02:\n Object of Interest\n\n\n\n\nINPUT\u00a0L5\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0CODE/4366/EYES\u00a0ONLY\n\n\n\n\nCLEARANCE\u00a0CODE\u00a0ACCEPTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=Warning: Top Secret=\n\n\nFoundation Site-98/4366 Confidential\n\n\nThe following information below is exclusive to those working under the operation of the Department of Extradimensional Anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.3:\n Object of Interest recovered near the northeastern fence of the exclusion zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n November 3, 2019\n\n\n \n\n\nHistory:\n On 11/03/19, during a routine inspection of SCP-4366's exclusion zone, \nMTF Lambda-4\n Agent Brown discovered a reflective metallic object poking out from under the ground near the northeastern side of the zone. Agent Brown sent a recovery crew to unearth the object out of protocol that any SCP-4366 flying overhead would notice the shining object and attempt to remove it; damaging the zone's fence in the process.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of Object:\n Upon recovery of the object, it was noted to possess technology found in Scranton-Marlowe Topology Stabilizers (SMTS) and Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA). The rest of the object's contents appear to serve an unknown function.\n\n\n \n\nAs the object itself was deemed non-functioning, it was dismantled and later identified to be similar in design to a Gears-Morgan Dimensional Frequency Stabilizer; A device designed to stabilize the vibrational frequencies in exotic matter. Currently in its conceptual stage of development as part of Project STEPPING STONE under the supervision of the project's lead directors, \nDr. Charles Gears\n and Dr. Terrence Morgan\n5\n. Further inspection of the object shows that it was capable of processing subatomic particles and ejecting them under different qualities. An impossibility thought as plausible based on the theories and works of Dr. Hume, despite the amount of energy needed and the limitations of current developing technologies that are required to do so.\n\n\n \n\nFurther research into the properties of the device and how it ended up inside SCP-4366's enclosure is still ongoing.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

The geological epoch which lasted from 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago, and the sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era.\n\n\n3\n. Frequency was compared to that of \nSCP-4340\n, another anomaly related to forest avians.\n\n\n4\n. Due to their perceptual camouflage, objects taken by SCP-4366 organisms are often described as \"flying, floating lights\" or UFOs.\n\n\n5\n. Further information regarding the technological applications of this device are classified under O5 Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4365\n | SCP-4366 | \nSCP-4367\n \u00bb",
