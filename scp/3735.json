According to non-anomalous phonetic analysis, said sound is impossible for human beings to produce. Nevertheless, approximately 0.03% of humans are anomalously able to produce SCP-3735 (a condition henceforth designated SCP-3735a). In most cases, this ability never manifests itself and SCP-3735a-positive individuals live normal lives, albeit at a statistically significant higher risk for late-life hearing loss.\n\n\nHowever, when SCP-3735a-positive individuals are exposed to SCP-3735, they have a 93% chance of developing the ability to produce SCP-3735, upon which their condition is reclassified as SCP-3735b. SCP-3735b-positive individuals feel a compulsion to repeatedly produce SCP-3735, developing in multiple stages.\n\n\n\n\nStage B1 (immediately after exposure): SCP-3735 immediately replaces all dorsal nasals in the affected individual\u2019s phonetic inventory.\n\n\nStage B2 (1 week after exposure): Coronal nasals, dorsal approximants, and any and all laryngeal consonants are replaced.\n\n\nStage B3 (7 weeks after exposure): All nasals and approximants, as well as voiced coronal and dorsal fricatives, are replaced.\n\n\nStage B4 (5 months after exposure): All consonants other than labial plosives and unvoiced labial fricatives are replaced, as well as all back vowels.\n\n\nStage B5 (1 year after exposure): All phonemes are replaced with SCP-3735.\n\n\n\n\nAs far as Foundation linguists can determine, SCP-3735b is entirely unconscious and irreversible, whether by amnestics or by any other means. SCP-3735b-positive individuals can understand spoken language, and hear nothing abnormal about their own speech.\n\n\nUpon being exposed to SCP-3735, SCP-3735a-negative individuals develop symptoms based on exposure time. These symptoms cease upon conclusion of exposure, and their effects can easily be removed from memory through use of class-B amnestics if concluded before reaching Stage A5.\n\n\n\n\nStage A1 (upon exposure): Mild headache\n\n\nStage A2 (thirty seconds of exposure): Throbbing headache, hyperventilation, a sensation of a \u201cswollen tongue.\u201d\n\n\nStage A3 (one minute of exposure): Sharp headache, difficulty breathing, overproduction of saliva, visible swelling of the tongue\n\n\nStage A4 (two minutes of exposure): Acute anaphylaxis\n\n\nStage A5 (three minutes of exposure): The pharynx and tongue [REDACTED], inevitably causing severe blood loss and expiration.\n\n\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-3735 was first identified in 2015, when an SCP-3735b-positive individual posted a recording of SCP-3735 in an online linguistics hobbyist group. Foundation online automated auditory memetic hazard scanners were triggered, and upon investigation by a Foundation linguist SCP-3735's anomalous properties were identified. The recording was deleted, SCP-3735a-negative listeners were treated and amnestized, and MTF Mu-143 \u201cPrescriptivists\u201d was deployed to contain the recording's originator, by the name of C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n C\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-3735b-positive individual\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. I\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Foundation linguist\n\n\nForeword:\n This interview was, except when \nmarked in italics\n, conducted solely through written means, so as to prevent exposure to SCP-3735.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nC\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I don't know what you are doing here, but it has got to be illegal.\n\n\nDr. P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n This will go a lot easier for you if you cooperate, sir.

She said she had a bad headache, and never came back. I think that was a pathetic excuse. What a bitch.\n\n\nDr. P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Ah.

At least I work from home at a normal job, instead of at some sort of weird secret research facility.\n\n\nDr. P\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Again, it would be easier for both of us if you work with us. When was the most recent time you had a full conversation with someone?\n\n\nC\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 N\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I guess it was about five months ago. An old friend from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 High\n2\n called me. I don't know how he got my number, to be honest. But we talked for a few minutes until he abruptly hung up.

In linguistics, a \nphone\n is defined as a distinct speech sound or gesture regardless of whether its exact sound is critical to the meaning of the word. This is distinct from a \nphoneme\n, which, if swapped with another phoneme, could alter the word's meaning. For instance, in English, \naspirated phones\n are \nallophonic\n and do not alter the meaning of the word, whereas in Hindi aspirated phones are distinct phonemes.\n\n\n2\n. Said school has not been identified.\n\n\n3\n. Said individual has not been identified. He has been reclassified as PoI-3735 for the time being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3734\n | SCP-3735 | \nSCP-3736\n \u00bb",
