Personnel wishing to conduct tests involving SCP-348 are to obtain Level 3 or higher authorization, and present a detailed list of intended test subjects.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-348 is a white ceramic bowl patterned with light blue flowers, measuring approximately 20\u00a0cm in diameter and 9\u00a0cm high. While no maker\u2019s marks are present, the Chinese characters for \u201cthinking of you\u201d (\u60f3\u7740\u4f60, \u201c\nxi\u01ceng zhe n\u01d0\n\u201d) are etched into the side of the bowl.\n\n\nWhen in the presence of an individual afflicted with a minor ailment or injury (i.e., mild cough, runny nose, scrapes), SCP-348 will fill with soup. While the ingredients present within the soups produced by SCP-348 vary, young subjects (individuals between the ages of 4 and 18) have consistently stated that they enjoyed the meal, sometimes stating that it reminds them of their parents\u2019 cooking. Subjects will finish the soup found in SCP-348 if allowed.\n\n\nChildren who eat from SCP-348 several times often express a feeling of contentment, stating that though they are eating by themselves, they do not feel lonely.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-348-1:\n SCP-348 was acquired shortly after rumors of a child living in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 apparently possessing remarkable recovery abilities came to the Foundation\u2019s attention. Investigation revealed that the child in question originally discovered SCP-348 in the attic of their house, and had come to rely on it after receiving insufficient attention from their parents. The child's parents, both full-time workers, refused to comment on their relationship with the child.\n\n\nResulting testing involving children was carried out under the guise of surveys to gauge the success of new food items offered at public schools.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-348-2:\n It has been noted that occasionally, after soup produced by SCP-348 has been consumed, a message will materialize on the inside of the bowl. Words produced on the inside of the bowl appear to be printed on the ceramic consistent with existing markings; the message that appears will be in the language most familiar to the drinker of the soup. After several hours (or when SCP-348 produces another meal), the words disappear.\n\n\n\n\nTesting Log SCP-348-1323-\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n 8-year-old female, afflicted with sore throat\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Lives with and is on good terms with both parents\n\n\nNotes:\n Subject took approximately 30 minutes to consume soup, remarked later that sore throat seemed to have gone away\n\n\nSubject:\n 10 year-old-male, recently injured self while biking (minor bruising)\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Lives with both parents, often argues with both\n\n\nNotes:\n Message appeared, \nDon\u2019t forget to brush.\n\n\nSubject:\n 11-year-old male, afflicted with slight cold\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Lives with foster parents\n\n\nNotes:\n Message appeared, \nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy.\n\n\nSubject:\n 9-year-old female, afflicted with slight cold\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Lives with both parents, said to be prone to tantrums\n\n\nNotes:\n Nothing of note occurred during or immediately after testing, subject stated while she didn\u2019t particularly care for the soup after tasting it, she still wanted to eat it. Follow-up investigations revealed that the subject recovered from the cold faster than was expected.\n\n\nSubject:\n 6-year-old male, recently injured self while playing with friends (minor scrapes and scratches)\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Parents divorced, currently lives with mother\n\n\nNotes:\n Message appeared, \nI\u2019m sorry, son.\n\n\nSubject:\n 7-year-old female, afflicted with cough\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Lives with mother and grandmother, father deceased (traffic accident)\n\n\nNotes:\n Message appeared, \nI love you.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum SCP-348-3:\n Testing has revealed that in the event that someone older than 18 years of age attempts to consume soup created by SCP-348, the individual will find that they are less inclined to finish the meal. Some such individuals will remark that \u201csomething is missing,\" most will simply state that the soup was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\nFurther studies carried out with older subjects indicate that though messages will appear for individuals older than 18, the appearance of the messages is worn and faded. (see testing log)\n\n\n\n\nTesting Log SCP-348-2635-\u2588\n\n\nNote: It was observed that though over one hundred subjects were tested, only four individuals received messages from SCP-348.\n\n\nSubject:\n 30-year-old female, afflicted with headache\n\n\nBrief Background:\n On poor terms with both parents.

After the contents of SCP-348 were disposed of, SCP-348 immediately filled with what appeared to be salt water, which remained for three hours before disappearing.\n\n\nSubject:\n 45-year-old male, afflicted with aches due to arthritis\n\n\nBrief Background:\n Happily married, lives with wife and children.

The subject, a grandfather with multiple grandchildren, stated that the soup produced by SCP-348 was \u201cthe best he\u2019d ever tasted\u201d. Following the test, the subject reported feeling a sense of \u201csatisfaction\u201d and noted that the pain caused by the illness seemed to have faded. The subject passed away peacefully a week later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-347\n | SCP-348 | \nSCP-349\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-348\n\" by Zyn, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
