No further security measures are necessary.\n\n\nNo written records or computers are permitted within the testing chamber outside of pre-approved testing materials. All data is to be transcribed from video after testing is completed. If tests require that a camera be brought within SCP-1722\u2019s area of effect, staff overseeing testing are to communicate in American Sign Language.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1722 is a branch of white oak measuring approximately 1.7 meters in length. SCP-1722 is decorated with various acrylic paints, colored duct tape, strips of leather, and feathers of the Canada goose (\nBranta canadensis\n). A partially completed string bracelet is attached to the item. Removed decorations have no anomalous properties of their own.\n\n\nWhen SCP-1722 is held by a human subject, the contents of all physical and digital documents within a five-meter radius will be permanently altered to contain handwritten commentary and proofreading notes, often in sufficient quantity to hinder the reading of the document. Video footage and audio recordings will be altered by the addition of a voice providing commentary, similar to edits made to texts. This voice is that of an adult male, estimated to be approximately 60 years of age.\n\n\nNo information contained within affected records will be deleted, and likewise no information will be added. Handwriting, vocabulary, syntax is consistent across all alterations.\n\n\nAddendum-01:\n Notable commentary:\n\n\nA speech written by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an 18th-century member of the British parliament.\n\n\n\n\nLook, now, you\u2019re on the right track here, but just think about what you\u2019re saying. Stomping down on the colonists is just going to get ugly for all parties involved. Best option would be to keep them as a semi-autonomous district, with a locally elected official serving as regional governor, accompanied by a second position who serves as representative in parliament. Also, knock it off with those curly fs. They\u2019re annoying as shit to read.\n\n\n\n\nAn excerpt of \u201cImmersion Deeps\u201d, a fanfiction.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the fifth apostrophe I\u2019ve had to place in THIS FUCKING PARAGRAPH. You know what? Fuck it. I\u2019m not reading this any more. [The remaining 71 pages are unedited.]\n\n\n\n\nA recording of an infomercial for \u201cHandy Helping Hampers\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWho the hell can\u2019t store their own clothing? Like, are you literally so incompetent with those gigantic meaty lobster claws you call hands that you can\u2019t figure out how to store and fold your own clothing? Really?\n\n\u2026\n\nEhhhh\u2026two for twenty\u2019s a pretty good deal, when you think about it. Maybe I can give \u2018em to someone for Christmas.\n\n\n\n\nSmashmaster!\n, a single-issue comic book\n\n\n\n\nWait what? Wait, what? Why is he doing this? Why is she doing that? What\u2019s wrong with his arm? What\u2019s wrong with her boobs? Who paid for this? Who paid money to read this? Why are they wearing tights in the arctic? Did this guy ever go to art school? What does this monologue even MEAN? Why does this exist? WHY?\n\n\n\n\nA United States 1040 income tax form\n\n\n\n\nYou know what would be great? A flat rate sales tax. You get more tax revenue due to the lack of exceptions, it's already graded for wealth levels, and you get to gut ALL of the IRS.\n\n\nOh wait, America.\n\n\n\n\nSultan of Spice\n, a romance novel.\n\n\n\n\nAND THEN THEY FUCKED AND GOOD GOD THIS PROSE IS PURPLE.

The singing is occasionally interrupted by interjections \u201cYeah!\u201d \u201cYou tell \u2018em, Bob!\u201d]\n\n\n\n\nPrince Hamlet\u2019s soliloquy in Act 1, Scene 2 of \nHamlet.\n\n\n\n\nGODDAMMIT SHUT UP.\n\n\n\n\nFrench art-house film \nJoyeux Fromage\n\n\n\n\n[Entire commentary is in fluent French, criticizing the writing and acting, though praising the imagery.]\n\n\n\n\nA video recording of SCP-1722 experiments.\n\n\n\n\nOh look, it\u2019s a guy with a stick.
