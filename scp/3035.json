Site-173 has two entry points: Entry A and Entry B.\n\n\nEntry A, the primary entrance, has been buried beneath 4 meters of concrete. Entry B, a vacuum-tube transit system, is used for deliveries to and from the interior of Site-173. MTF Nu-13 (\"Rasczak's Roughnecks\") is to maintain a provisional base at Entry B. They are to terminate any instance of SCP-3035 on sight.\n\n\nApproximately once a week, a package will emerge from Entry B's vacuum-tube system. Typically, this package will contain various non-anomalous materials (see below). Each package is to be placed in quarantine, where it is to be examined, documented, and then incinerated.\n\n\nEntry into Site-173 is prohibited until further notice.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3035 is a strain of \nPeriplaneta americana\n (American cockroach, or water-bug) that mimics the behavior and outward appearance of organisms it observes.\n\n\nThis mimicry is superficial. For example: While an instance of SCP-3035 may reproduce the coloration and behavior patterns of bumblebees, they will not reproduce a bee's complex social network or unique form of communication.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-3035 will mimic each other more rapidly than other organisms. This leads to a feedback loop: One instance will adopt a new attribute, only for all other instances to immediately mimic the first instance, acquiring the attribute for themselves.\n\n\nIt should be emphasized that this mimicry is only a shallow approximation \u2014 an attempt by some as-of-yet unknown process to 'look' and 'act' like something else. Regardless of the extent of this mimicry, instances of SCP-3035 still retain many of the characteristics associated with cockroaches.\n\n\nAddendum 3035.1:\n Site-173 Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3035/package_manifests/january_2012.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVED ON:\n 01/05/2012\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n\n\n3 keyboards (broken)\n\n\n6 sealed test-tubes (filled)\n\n\n3 unsealed test-tubes (empty)\n\n\n0.25\u00a0kg assorted organs (cockroach, fresh)\n\n\n0.5\u00a0kg assorted organs (human, decomposed)\n\n\n7 syringes (seals intact)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Contents of sealed test-tubes not identified; presumed to be either sewage, blood, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVED ON:\n 01/12/2012\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n\n\n1 keyboard (broken)\n\n\n3 unsealed test-tubes (empty)\n\n\n0.15\u00a0kg assorted organs (cockroach, fresh)\n\n\n0.25\u00a0kg assorted organs (human, decomposed)\n\n\n1 syringe (broken)\n\n\n1 clipboard\n\n\n1 legal pad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Legal pad contained illegible scribbles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVED ON:\n 01/22/2012\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n\n\n1 computer mouse (broken)\n\n\n2 unsealed test-tubes (empty)\n\n\n10\u00a0g roach eggs\n\n\n15.5\u00a0kg assorted organs (human, fresh)\n\n\n1 coffee mug (text: \"I Hate Mondays\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Roach eggs destroyed immediately as per procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25ba\u00a0ACCESS\u00a0SCP:/3035/emails/february_2007.log\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Close\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 02/01/2007\n\n\nFROM:\n Dr. Breeman <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|nameerbp#noitadnuof.pcs|nameerbp\n>\n\n\nTO:\n Dr. Xao <\nnoitadnuof.pcs|oaxh#noitadnuof.pcs|oaxh\n>\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n Unusual Behavior\n\n\n\n\nWe noticed something while finishing up with the latest batteries of tests.

Last night, after I left, one of them pinned another one down on top of the table. It used what looked like\u2026 sharpened tips on its forelegs to cut it open. Then, it started methodically removing the still-living bug's fatty tissues.

The curious part is that every test I've performed on them still indicates that they have the intelligence of your basic, run-of-the-mill cockroach. They can mimic behavior, but they can't mimic understanding; they copy my actions, but they don't understand why I do something. Or even what something means. ATTACHMENTS: walking.mp5",

The props are far too large, but I was curious if they'll try using them. And, well\u2026 If you've ever wanted to know what a bunch of cockroaches sitting at an over-sized table, typing away at keyboards that aren't even there looks like\u2026 I've attached a video that should satisfy your curiosity. I even got one of them to 'drink' from a tiny toy coffee mug (case_of_the_mondays.png). ATTACHMENTS: monday_meeting.mp5, case_of_the_mondays.png",

Per your request, I performed a biopsy on their nervous system. I've sent the results to you \u2014 as you can see, there's no new growth, no new structures \u2014 they're still just cockroaches. Bizarrely large cockroaches that walk around. And type at empty desks. And pretend to drink coffee. I felt a little bad about killing one of them; it's hard not to think of them as my little pupils. Still, none of the others seemed to mind. They're all just happily strutting about, acting like nothing even happened. ATTACHMENTS: biopsy_report.pdf",

This morning, I returned to the lab only to find one of the cockroaches on its back atop of the table, dead. It had been somehow \u2014 sliced open and gutted. The other cockroaches were just strutting around like nothing was wrong. I reviewed the footage from yesterday. Last night, after I left, one of them pinned another one down on top of the table. It used what looked like\u2026 sharpened tips on its forelegs to cut it open. Then, it started methodically removing the still-living bug's fatty tissues. Like it was scooping up ice-cream. Once it was done, it sat at the table and started tapping away at the invisible keyboard again. Like it was taking notes and writing emails based on the results. Just like me. They saw my autopsy, Dr. Xao. They saw it, and then they mimicked it. I think this experiment has gone on far enough. ATTACHMENTS: <None>",

        "TO WHOMEVER IT MAY CONCERN: After three disastrous attempts at a rescue mission, we're giving up. Every time we send a squad of soldiers down there, these things start adapting their behavior and appearance \u2014 becoming more and more aggressive. On top of that, they breed like\u2026 well, cockroaches. Nu-13 will be stationed at Entry B; they'll stay as long as they can and wait to see if anything human comes out. But as of this moment, I'm declaring Site-173 a lost cause. The decision regarding whether or not to deploy nerve-toxins to clear Site-173 of SCP-3035 instances is under review \u2014 particularly in light of the recent revelation that some of the human organs emerging from Entry B are fresh. - Dr. Henry Xao",
