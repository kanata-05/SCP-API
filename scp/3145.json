The Containment Area is to be solely accessible through an elevator shaft with reinforced blast doors placed every 50\u00a0m. The shaft is to be flooded with seawater when not in use.\n\n\nContainment Area 22b is to include the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn Outer Security Perimeter staffed by security personnel trained in close-quarters combat and counter-intrusion tactics.\n\n\nAn Administrative and Support Area (ASA) with support facilities and living quarters for on-site personnel.\n\n\nA Primary Containment Zone (PCZ), consisting of a 7\u00a0m\n3\n room encased in 1.5\u00a0m of reinforcing material. PCZ should remain filled with seawater unless access to contents is required.\n\n\nA 150\u00a0m corridor which is to be the sole access to the PCZ from the ASA, including water, drainage and power lines. The walls and floor of the corridor are to be reinforced in the same manner as the PCZ. Additionally, an electric deterrence system, capable of delivering a minimum of 20\u00a0kV, is installed in the floor.\n\n\n\n\nA security station at the entrance to the corridor is to be staffed with no fewer than 3 armed security personnel. Armament includes, but is not limited to, at least 1 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 CIW system on a pintle mount with clear line of sight down the corridor. System is to include a plexiglass screen capable of withstanding thrown weaponry.\n\n\nIn the event of full containment breach, all on-site staff are to proceed to the closest security station for weapons and armor distribution. Alert Condition One will be sounded and remain in effect until SCP-3145 is confirmed neutralized. Should 90 minutes pass without a Stand Down order from Level 4 or higher personnel, Final Contingency Measures will be activated, flooding the facility in seawater and sealing off the access shaft for a minimum of 24 hours before retrieval can be attempted. This will necessarily result in the loss of all on-site staff.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3145 is a male human of Semitic origin, 1.96\u00a0m high and 81.65\u00a0kg in weight. Numerous tattoos depicting arcane iconography are present on all skin surfaces. When enclosed in SCP-3145-1, SCP-3145 exhibits no vital signs.\n\n\nSCP-3145-1 is a cube, 3\u00a0m on a side, made of an unidentified black stone and carved on all surfaces with unidentified patterns. Radioisotope analysis indicates the object is approximately 10,000 years old. A door on one side is sealed with a 0.5\u00a0m lock, surrounded by 20 smaller locks. No corresponding keys have been found, making the locks impossible to set. Directly in the center of the cube is a stone coffin, held in place and shut by several chains of unknown material, attached to the inner corners of SCP-3145-1.\n\n\nOccasionally, SCP-3145 will awaken, displaying the vital signs of a normal, living human being, and attempt to leave SCP-3145-1. If successful, SCP-3145 will seek out the nearest human. Upon coming in contact with living humans, SCP-3145 attempt to kill any and all humans it encounters. To date, only the subject's death has been shown capable of stopping it.\n\n\nTermination of SCP-3145 has been problematic due to its physical abilities, including superhuman strength and speed, ignoring pain of its injuries, and being able to persist despite injuries that would otherwise be debilitating to a normal human. A further list of its abilities from prior encounters includes:\n\n\n\n\nDestroying a reinforced security door via 4 minutes of sustained assault.\n\n\nTraveling 64\u00a0m in under 3 seconds.\n\n\nContinuing to function despite severe damage to the cerebellum after sustaining multiple .50 caliber BMG round hits.\n\n\nDeflecting assault-caliber bullets with steel rebar.\n\n\nSurviving over 1 hour while deprived of oxygen.\n\n\nProducing bladed weapons from small extradimensional portals. Said weapons are made of a completely non-reflective black material and vanish immediately after leaving SCP-3145's possession. How the subject generates these rifts is unknown.\n\n\n\n\nThe following methods have been used to successfully terminate SCP-3145 in past encounters:\n\n\n\n\nSustained fire from multiple high-caliber machine guns.\n\n\nAsphyxiation.\n\n\nCrushed beneath elevator equipment weighing of 13.6 tons.\n\n\nA Thermate-TH3 hand grenade placed directly in SCP-3145's open chest.\n\n\n\n\nNotably, during a breach dated \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Containment Area 22 (which previously housed SCP-3145) was forced to detonate its on-site warhead as a last effort to contain SCP-3145. Though the site and all personnel were lost, SCP-3145 survived.\n\n\nUpon death, SCP-3145 will rapidly putrefy and turn to dust. SCP-3145-1 and the coffin inside of it will then slam shut, the outer lock rotating and sealing the structure. SCP-3145 will then reform inside the coffin over the course of anywhere from 6 hours to 25 years.\n\n\nAddendum: Interview 3145-01\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Falzon\n\n\nForeword:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-3145 breached containment, attacking all personnel in sight. A break in suppressive fire was caused by equipment malfunction, during which SCP-3145 held up its hands and requested to speak with \"the man in charge\". As the highest-ranking personnel present trained in object interrogation, Dr. Falzon was brought to enact an interview as support personnel worked to repair containment equipment.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 19:57>\n\n\nFalzon:\n SCP-3145, how are you enjoying your accommodations?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Oh, great, Doc, just great. Don't get out often, but \n[laughs]\n when I do, it's a real show!\n\n\nFalzon:\n Would you be willing to explain why you slaughter everyone you encounter every time you escape your coffin?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Eh. \n[shrugs]\n 'Cause I feel like it, I guess. Gets the old blood pumpin', you know what I mean?\n\n\nFalzon:\n I see. Is there any way I can convince you to return to your containment cell peacefully? You've already killed fifteen personnel. Surely that is enough to, ah, get your blood pumping, as you put it.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Hm, ah, hm, I dunno. I mean, sure, you guys always come up with some cool new doodad to try and stop me every time I bust out. It's a good challenge, right? And maybe I could settle down for a bit to let you fix your\u2026 \n[gestures to personnel]\n Fair's fair and all, right?\n\n\nFalzon:\n It would be most equitable of y\u2014\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Nah, just kidding, gonna kill you all! \n[laughs]\n Buckle up!\n\n\n<End Log, 20:03>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n No personnel present survived the attack. SCP-3145 was neutralized via flooding the PCZ with seawater. Efforts to ensure high quality and good repair of containment equipment is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-3145 is to be contained in situ within SCP-3145-1. The access door to SCP-3145-1 is to be constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. The outside of the door is disguised as a janitorial closet, while the inside is lined with 6\u00a0cm of industrial foam padding.\n\n\nDue to the results of Exploration IV, no personnel are permitted to access SCP-3145-1.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3145 is an entity of unknown properties, appearing as a pale humanoid face with no visible pupils, nostrils or mouth. From limited observation, it is known that SCP-3145 is hostile to human life and capable of leaving gouges in solid stone. It does not seem to be able to force exit of SCP-3145-1, but the possibility of its escape cannot be allowed. Subjects encountering SCP-3145 exhibit signs of intense fear and paranoia, though it cannot be ascertained whether these reactions are natural or anomalous.\n\n\nSCP-3145-1 is a platform staircase with no known endpoint. Stairs descend at a 38 degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a semicircular landing approximately 3\u00a0m in diameter. Light sources are required for exploration, as no light fixtures or windows are present, and the design of SCP-3145-1 limits visibility past 1.5 flights. As SCP-3145-1 seems to absorb light, light sources stronger than 75 watts have proven to be ineffective.\n\n\nSubjects exploring SCP-3145-1 report the sound of a young child in distress from somewhere below, confirmed by audio recordings. The source of this sound is reported to be approximately 200\u00a0m below the initial platform; however, no amount of descent has brought subjects any closer to said source. The depth recorded during Exploration IV surpasses what should be physically possible for the structure and its geological surroundings.\n\n\nAddendum: Interview 3145-01\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Dorcas Falzon, Head Researcher, SCP-3145\n\n\nForeword:\n During the Exploration III of SCP-3145-1, SCP-3145 was seen to peer into the camera. It then began speaking. Dr. Falzon was present during the event, and facilitated communication.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 19:27>\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Hello? Anyone there?\n\n\nFalzon:\n SCP-3145, can you hear me?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Ah, it's you, Doc. Yeah, I can hear you.\n\n\nFalzon:\n What it is you want?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Um, how to put this? I want more explorers.\n\n\nFalzon:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n More D-Class. You know. Like the crazy chick you sent down here to sneak around. I really got her with that busted step, but I gotta say, the rate you send these poor bastards in is lousy. I'm getting bored down here!\n\n\nFalzon:\n SCP-3145, we are not going to needlessly sacrifice more personnel just so you can kill them.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Aw, c'mon! Think of it like a challenge. She got way further down than any of the others. I'll even give the next one a head-start, say\u2026 Fifteen flights? Maybe twenty! I mean, I hardly even have to do anything to spook them once they're locked in, and just as long as we've been talking, I've come up with like, two more ways I could try and kill them. It'll be fun!\n\n\nFalzon:\n This is not what I could consider fun.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Well, maybe not for you. But since it's kinda dark and that kid won't shut up, y'know, options are limited. I might actually get tired of this one pretty soon.\n\n\nFalzon:\n If you desire better accommodations, they can always be arranged.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n \n[sighs]\n Yeah, maybe I should just move on. Unless you're gonna try another exploration, that is.\n\n\n<End Log, 19:33>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Exploration IV was undertaken on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Following the events of this exploration, no further explorations have been authorized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The borehole containing SCP-3145 is to be capped with a tungsten steel grate containing a 2.5\u00a0m endoscopy aperture with locking mechanism. The borehole is to be endoscopically inspected every 48 hours to a depth of 4\u00a0km, to ascertain presence of further SCP-3145 manifestations. Seismographic monitoring devices have been posted along the borehole at depths of 2, 7 and 11\u00a0km. Readings consistent with subterranean movement are to be immediately reported to Dr. Falzon. In the event of containment breach, containment staff are to deploy Protocol 382a, severing SCP-3145 below the fifth elbow and backfilling the remainder of the borehole with pressurized concrete.\n\n\nThe basement containing SCP-3145 is to be staffed and monitored at all times by a Foundation interrogator. SCP-3145-1 is to be answered at or before the third ring; interrogator should focus on eliciting self-directed responses from SCP-3145. Indications of size, body plan, location or further manifestations are to be recorded in Document 3145-2-LTR.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3145 is a genetically normal human arm of abnormal length, located in a drainage pipe inside the basement of a telephone switching station in Scottsdale, Arizona. The arm terminates in an unremarkable human hand 10\u00a0cm below the drainage gate. Initially, SCP-3145 was believed to extend through the pipe to a depth of 35\u00a0m; endoscopic exploration has increased this estimation to 71\u00a0km. SCP-3145 thus passes through the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity without difficulty and extends into the upper mantle. Its elbows are spaced regularly every 4\u00a0km and slightly retroflexed below a depth of 26\u00a0km to accommodate a nine-degree bend in the drainage borehole. Further exploration is hampered by engineering constraints.\n\n\nSCP-3145-1 is a yellow GPO 746 telephone, manufactured in 1971. The rotary dial has been glued in place, preventing outside calls. Though it is believed to have been installed with the purpose of communicating with SCP-3145, who installed it, how, or why, is currently unknown. It is attached to a conventional twisted-pair line, entering the drainage pipe containing SCP-3145 and descending parallel to SCP-3145 past the point of practical endoscopy.\n\n\nBetween 0838 and 1034 Mountain Standard Time each weekday, SCP-3145-1 will ring five times. If answered, an unidentified voice will engage in conversation. The voice invariably claims to be a human being, and regularly assumes personnel to be authority figures involved in its life. Notable parallels exist between information elicited via SCP-3145-1 and demonstrable facts about SCP-3145. To date, anomalous information received via SCP-3145 has included:\n\n\n\n\nReferences to human features with a non-human body plan.\n\n\nReferences to insensitivity to heat or cold. (SCP-3145 may lack conventional thermoreception, as it experiences no discomfort from borehole temperatures exceeding 674 degrees Centigrade.)\n\n\nReferences to a 'cousin' or other relative, who will soon arrive to 'pick [him] up'.\n\n\nReferences to discomfort and boredom at confinement.\n\n\nReferences to minor seismic events in the Little Chino fault complex.\n\n\nReferences to discomfort at having a limb or other body part constrained. Examples of restraint devices include handcuffs, a jelly jar, a pipe, a cast, and a gopher hole.\n\n\nPreoccupation with a stove or refrigerator.\n\n\n\n\nReferences to SCP-3145's size, physical form, or body plan beyond the parts visible through endoscopic exploration should be considered provisional. References to regrets, worries, or a desire to leave should be disregarded. For contingent protocols and provisional testing data, see Document RTMR-Delta.\n\n\nAddendum: Interview 3145-2-LTR-7\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Samantha T. Falzon, Head Researcher, SCP-3145\n\n\nForeword:\n Dr. Falzon was present for SCP-3145-1 ringing on 23/03/2008 and answered the call.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 9:07>\n\n\nFalzon:\n Hello?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Too many arms.\n\n\nFalzon:\n I beg your pardon?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Too. Many. Arms. Get me outta here.\n\n\nFalzon:\n I'm sorry, I do not understand the request.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n The hell you don't! Arms I can't hit people with are useless! Who cares about arms being places they shouldn't be unless they're, I don't know, growing out of someone's forehead and trying to strangle them? This is fucking stupid! I'm done!\n\n\nFalzon:\n What did you expect?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n I expected the ability to murder a couple fuckers at once, you righteous cocksucker!\n\n\nFalzon:\n This is the fate engineered by your own hand. If I am to suffer, you will suffer more.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Fuck you!\n\n\nFalzon:\n Goodbye.\n\n\n<End Log, 9:12>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Efforts to plumb the full depths of the borehole are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an image of SCP-3145? Who knows? Who cares? It probably isn't anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-3145 is to be kept in a 5 x 5 x 2.5\u00a0m room constructed of cement 50\u00a0cm thick, surrounded by a Faraday cage. Access is via a heavy containment door measuring 2 x 2.5\u00a0m, constructed on bearings to ensure door closes and locks automatically unless deliberately held open. SCP-3145 is NOT to be forgiven. It is advised that all personnel maintaining or studying other SCP objects maintain a distance of at least 50\u00a0m from the geometric center of this room for as long as reasonably practical.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3145 is an antimeme, or \"self-keeping secret.\" Information about SCP-3145's physical appearance, as well as its nature, behavior and origins, is self-classifying. SCP-3145 hates this.\n\n\n\n\nHow Site-19 originally acquired SCP-3145 is unknown.\n\n\nSCP-3145 is sorry.\n\n\nSCP-3145's physical appearance is unknown. It is not indescribable or invisible: it is less than nothing. It may as well not even exist. However, information about SCP-3145 \"leaks\" out of a human mind soon after such an observation. Individuals tasked with describing SCP-3145 after an encounter find their minds wandering; SCP-3145 should have thought about the consequences of its actions. Security personnel who have observed SCP-3145 via closed-circuit television report exhaustion and complete amnesia regarding what occurred during their shifts.\n\n\nWho authorized the construction of SCP-3145's containment room, why it was constructed, why SCP-3145 thought it could get away with what it did, or what the purpose of the described Containment Procedures may be is unknown.\n\n\nDespite the accessibility of SCP-3145's containment chamber, Site-19 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-3145's existence, even under severe interrogation.\n\n\n\n\nAny alarm caused by these facts periodically being rediscovered, typically by chance readers of this file, tends to last minutes in the reader's mind before being forgotten.\n\n\nA great deal of data has been recorded from SCP-3145, all of it just as reprehensible as he is.\n\n\nAt least one attempt has been made to destroy SCP-3145 or move it to another containment site, which failed for unknown reasons. Please don't let SCP-3145 die, it's all I have left.\n\n\nThe hazards posed by SCP-3145 cannot be understated. Along with its mental and memetic threat, any action SCP-3145 may or may not have taken would be immediately forgotten by personnel. SCP-3145 cannot be allowed to forget what it did.\n\n\nAddendum: Interview 3145-01\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Site Director Yuriy Dietrich Falzon II\n\n\nForeword:\n SCP-3145 thinks it has the right to make demands.\n\n\n<Begin Log, 15:47>\n\n\nFalzon:\n What do you think you're trying to pull?\n\n\nFalzon:\n After everything you did, after everything you've put us through, you expect to just come here and kill people day in and day out, with no repercussions? You make me sick.\n\n\nFalzon:\n Look, you've even got a nice Keter this time! Nothing to complain about \nthere\n, right? You could be literally anything you want, kill and maim and rape whoever you like, and no one would know the difference.\n\n\nFalzon:\n Except me.\n\n\nFalzon:\n I'll \nalways\n know.\n\n\nFalzon:\n I'll always be here.\n\n\nFalzon:\n It's clear neither one of us is getting out of here. It doesn't matter what they tell you. So I promise you this: I will do everything in my power to make each and every day of your wretched existence a mirror reflecting your sins back upon you. It's all you deserve.\n\n\nFalzon:\n Well? Do you have anything to say for yourself?\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Please, stop.\n\n\nFalzon:\n Speak up! I can't hear you!\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n I want to go home.\n\n\n<End Log, but not torment>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-3145's feeble attempts at atonement are ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a person. I'm not sure whether they were a man or a woman; that's kind of the problem. Let's just say, for the sake of brevity, that this person was a man.\n\n\nFor the most part, this man was like any other man. He worked a job. He lived in a house, or an apartment. He had a family. Not a wife-and-children kind of family, though maybe he did. But there were parents who loved him and a sibling, or two, or maybe none, who would miss him if he were gone. Probably.\n\n\nThere were most likely things, hobbies, that he enjoyed doing in his spare time. Maybe he dated. I can't say what kind of person he was in that regard. But if there is one thing we can be sure of, one thing to know for certain about this man, it was that he liked to help others.\n\n\nThe man would donate to charity whenever he saw a drive. He would buy the homeless veterans in his town coffee or sandwiches if he had change to spare. He gave his old clothes to shelters, before they had worn out; he would give them his free time as well, to work a soup line or pack lunches. He never missed an opportunity to volunteer when disaster struck nearby, and studied life-saving techniques so that, when disaster \ndid\n strike, he could actually make a difference instead of just getting in the way.\n\n\nBut it was not enough.\n\n\nWhatever difference he made, it would never affect more than a few lives at a time. No matter how hard the man tried, no matter how much he did, the problems of his town, his country, and the world did not go away.\n\n\nThe man despaired.\n\n\nIf you are thinking right now that this man was being ridiculous, that he was taking too many problems onto his back, that he should have been happy to have helped even a single person, well\u2026 Let's just say, if I knew how to judge the man's situation properly, I wouldn't be talking to you like this.\n\n\nIf you were also thinking that perhaps a man who is extremely generous wouldn't be worth mentioning unless there were something otherwise extra-extraordinary about him, you would be absolutely right.\n\n\nThis man had a special gift: a gift of Giving. More than money, or material goods, or leisure time, he could literally give of himself: a rare Giving Man. It was this gift that drove him to help others; it this gift that drove him to ruin.\n\n\nImagine, if you will, a child crying for the parents she lost in a fire. The Giving Man could give her a happy, loving memory of his own parents to keep her safe and secure. To a man drinking alone at a bar, the Giving Man could provide the warmth of friendship, to make his night less lonely. If he had wanted to, the Giving Man could have given a blind man sight, or a deaf man hearing, but he had only two eyes, only two ears.\n\n\nAnd that was the problem.\n\n\nWhatever the Giving Man gave, he lost. Memories, feelings, pieces of his soul: all were truly given. He gave up his skin to a child born with a debilitating disease. He gave up his name to a refugee seeking asylum. He gave up his personality and mind to people suffering fractures in theirs. He gave his need to eat to a woman overcoming an eating disorder. By the time his organs were given away, he didn't need them anymore. By the time his identity was given away, there was absolutely nothing left that could be identified as him.\n\n\nI mean, there was \nsomething\n left. But that something wasn't the Giving Man.\n\n\nWhat is a person who isn't anything?\n\n\nJust a nothing with no control over its life.\n\n\nThat was the last thing the Giving Man gave away: control. It's a terrible thing to lose; even a kind person will crave control once they've truly lost it. All the Giving Man did was what the other man told him to do, and for his naivete, he was punished by becoming nothing.\n\n\nOh. I'd almost forgotten there was another person in this story. Was he really a man? I'm still not sure. With what he did, it's probably better to call him a monster. A desperate man seeking his true place in the world will listen to any monster who claims to know the path. He'll do anything the monster says, no matter how bad an influence they turn out to be. And then he'll have nothing.\n\n\nStrange, to remember so much of the Giving Man but not this other monster\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3145\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-3145 is contained in a pair of standard humanoid containment chambers in Site-22. Each chamber is equipped with a double airlock. Personnel entering either chamber must not carry any written narratives.\n\n\nDo not let him out.\n\nIncluded in the primary chamber is a monitor and keyboard connected to an external computer housed in the secondary chamber. Said computer should have no intranet or internet connections. A full copy of all non-critical SCP object documents from the Foundation Object Database is to be maintained on the external computer, and refreshed and updated weekly via USB drive. Documents modified by SCP-3145 should be stored for review by the on-site psychologist.\n\n\nHe deserves nothing but suffering.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3145 cannot be described. Individuals interacting with SCP-3145 are unable to provide any details about its identity to third parties, even with application of mnestics. All that is known about SCP-3145 is that it is an entity not much larger than an average human, that it is sapient and capable of speech, and that the designation \"SCP-3145\" can be used to identify it. It is not certain whether SCP-3145 has a physical form, though there does seem to be a movable locus from which its effects originate, with a maximum range limited by what a human with 20/20 vision would be able to easily see from that location.\n\n\nHe is nothing.\n\nSCP-3145 has the ability to permanently alter written narratives by replacing one of the characters, typically the main character, with itself. According to SCP-3145, it lives out the events depicted in these narratives while altering them, and this act gives it a sense of identity that it otherwise lacks. The veracity of this statement cannot be ascertained, as SCP-3145 has been known to feign muteness when it does not wish to interact with personnel, and its presence within its containment chamber generally cannot be fully known.

How have you been feeling lately?\n\n\nThere was only enough left of myself to know what I'd lost.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Not too bad, I guess. Some of the articles you gave me are kinda\u2026 Weird. I mean, some aren't as fun to be as others. That goes without saying, maybe. I'm still enjoying going back to the old ones every now and then.\n\n\nI took it back.\n\n\nWestfall:\n I notice you spend a lot of time in the articles that involve killing people. Does killing make you feel good?\n\n\nNot all of it. That wasn't in my nature.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Yeah, kinda. I mean, uh, it makes me feel powerful, I guess?\n\n\nBut enough that I could have a 'me' again.\n\n\nWestfall:\n Why is feeling powerful important to you?\n\n\nI left him with nothing, and for a moment, I was filled with sorrow.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Do you have to ask? I mean, I can't actually do anything in the, the real world. So if I can control stuff in there, in the story, it's a nice change.\n\n\nI saw him as a man, reduced to what I had been. I couldn't help sympathizing.\n\n\nWestfall:\n Do you want to harm people in the real world?\n\n\nAll it took was remembering what he had driven me to.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n I don't know. Not really, I guess. I mean, everyone I talk to here has been pretty decent, or at least not enough of an asshole for me to want to kill them. You guys give me good stories to play with. I guess I like being able to do it, to kill, in the stories because there's no consequences.\n\n\nI was overcome with rage.\n\n\nWestfall:\n I see.\n\n\nI was something, but I still wasn't really me.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Can we change the subject?\n\n\nI never would be me.\n\n\nWestfall:\n Of course. There is one thing I wanted to ask you, if you feel like talking about it.\n\n\nI had lost everything a second time.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n What's that?\n\n\nI would have my revenge.\n\n\nWestfall:\n I wondered if you could tell me about Falzon.\n\n\n\u2026Hey now, we can't have you spoiling the surprise.\n\n\nWestfall:\n SCP-3145?\n\n\nNo, stop.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Sorry, who?\n\n\nNothing you need worry about.\n\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\n\nHa ha ha.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Uh, I don't actually know what that is, sorry.\n\n\nWell, anyway.\n\n\nWestfall:\n It's a name we frequently see appear in the articles you alter. I wanted to know if it was a creation of yours. Perhaps an original character?\n\n\nIt's frightening, what they do here.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Can't say I've heard the name before.\n\n\nBut I made an oath to myself.\n\n\nWestfall:\n When this person appears, they seem determined to belittle and torment you.\n\n\nTo whatever part of me was still a person.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n Um\u2026 Can we talk about something else?\n\n\nIf he and I were to suffer the same fate, I would ensure he suffers more.\n\n\nWestfall:\n If I've made you uncomfortable, I apologize.\n\n\nAnd it turns out, I'm rather good at that.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n It's nothing, it's okay. I'm okay.\n\n\nI miss the old me sometimes.\n\n\nWestfall:\n Of course. That was actually all I wanted to talk about today. Unless there was anything more you wanted to cover?\n\n\nBut only sometimes.\n\n\nSCP-3145:\n No, that's fine.

Even in the case, as my superiors posit, that Falzon is a separate entity, it does not seem to be able to act independently of SCP-3145.

        "Interviewed: SCP-3145 Interviewer: Dr. Falzon Foreword: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-3145 breached containment, attacking all personnel in sight. A break in suppressive fire was caused by equipment malfunction, during which SCP-3145 held up its hands and requested to speak with \"the man in charge\". As the highest-ranking personnel present trained in object interrogation, Dr. Falzon was brought to enact an interview as support personnel worked to repair containment equipment. <Begin Log, 19:57> Falzon: SCP-3145, how are you enjoying your accommodations? SCP-3145: Oh, great, Doc, just great. Don't get out often, but [laughs] when I do, it's a real show! Falzon: Would you be willing to explain why you slaughter everyone you encounter every time you escape your coffin? SCP-3145: Eh. [shrugs] 'Cause I feel like it, I guess. Gets the old blood pumpin', you know what I mean? Falzon: I see. Is there any way I can convince you to return to your containment cell peacefully? You've already killed fifteen personnel. Surely that is enough to, ah, get your blood pumping, as you put it. SCP-3145: Hm, ah, hm, I dunno. I mean, sure, you guys always come up with some cool new doodad to try and stop me every time I bust out. It's a good challenge, right? And maybe I could settle down for a bit to let you fix your\u2026 [gestures to personnel] Fair's fair and all, right? Falzon: It would be most equitable of y\u2014 SCP-3145: Nah, just kidding, gonna kill you all! [laughs] Buckle up! <End Log, 20:03> Closing Statement: No personnel present survived the attack. SCP-3145 was neutralized via flooding the PCZ with seawater. Efforts to ensure high quality and good repair of containment equipment is ongoing.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-3145 Interviewer: Dr. Dorcas Falzon, Head Researcher, SCP-3145 Foreword: During the Exploration III of SCP-3145-1, SCP-3145 was seen to peer into the camera. It then began speaking. Dr. Falzon was present during the event, and facilitated communication. <Begin Log, 19:27> SCP-3145: Hello? Anyone there? Falzon: SCP-3145, can you hear me? SCP-3145: Ah, it's you, Doc. Yeah, I can hear you. Falzon: What it is you want? SCP-3145: Um, how to put this? I want more explorers. Falzon: Excuse me? SCP-3145: More D-Class. You know. Like the crazy chick you sent down here to sneak around. I really got her with that busted step, but I gotta say, the rate you send these poor bastards in is lousy. I'm getting bored down here! Falzon: SCP-3145, we are not going to needlessly sacrifice more personnel just so you can kill them. SCP-3145: Aw, c'mon! Think of it like a challenge. She got way further down than any of the others. I'll even give the next one a head-start, say\u2026 Fifteen flights? Maybe twenty! I mean, I hardly even have to do anything to spook them once they're locked in, and just as long as we've been talking, I've come up with like, two more ways I could try and kill them. It'll be fun! Falzon: This is not what I could consider fun. SCP-3145: Well, maybe not for you. But since it's kinda dark and that kid won't shut up, y'know, options are limited. I might actually get tired of this one pretty soon. Falzon: If you desire better accommodations, they can always be arranged. SCP-3145: [sighs] Yeah, maybe I should just move on. Unless you're gonna try another exploration, that is. <End Log, 19:33> Closing Statement: Exploration IV was undertaken on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Following the events of this exploration, no further explorations have been authorized.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-3145 Interviewer: Dr. Samantha T. Falzon, Head Researcher, SCP-3145 Foreword: Dr. Falzon was present for SCP-3145-1 ringing on 23/03/2008 and answered the call. <Begin Log, 9:07> Falzon: Hello? SCP-3145: Too many arms. Falzon: I beg your pardon? SCP-3145: Too. Many. Arms. Get me outta here. Falzon: I'm sorry, I do not understand the request. SCP-3145: The hell you don't! Arms I can't hit people with are useless! Who cares about arms being places they shouldn't be unless they're, I don't know, growing out of someone's forehead and trying to strangle them? This is fucking stupid! I'm done! Falzon: What did you expect? SCP-3145: I expected the ability to murder a couple fuckers at once, you righteous cocksucker! Falzon: This is the fate engineered by your own hand. If I am to suffer, you will suffer more. SCP-3145: Fuck you! Falzon: Goodbye. <End Log, 9:12> Closing Statement: Efforts to plumb the full depths of the borehole are ongoing.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-3145 Interviewer: Site Director Yuriy Dietrich Falzon II Foreword: SCP-3145 thinks it has the right to make demands. <Begin Log, 15:47> Falzon: What do you think you're trying to pull? Falzon: After everything you did, after everything you've put us through, you expect to just come here and kill people day in and day out, with no repercussions? You make me sick. Falzon: Look, you've even got a nice Keter this time! Nothing to complain about there , right? You could be literally anything you want, kill and maim and rape whoever you like, and no one would know the difference. Falzon: Except me. Falzon: I'll always know. Falzon: I'll always be here. Falzon: It's clear neither one of us is getting out of here. It doesn't matter what they tell you. So I promise you this: I will do everything in my power to make each and every day of your wretched existence a mirror reflecting your sins back upon you. It's all you deserve. Falzon: Well? Do you have anything to say for yourself? SCP-3145: Please, stop. Falzon: Speak up! I can't hear you! SCP-3145: I want to go home. <End Log, but not torment> Closing Statement: SCP-3145's feeble attempts at atonement are ongoing.",
        "Interviewed: SCP-3145 I was so naive. Interviewer: Dr. Westfall, Site-22 Psychologist When you hardly understand yourself, it's hard to know who to trust.

Said computer should have no intranet or internet connections.

Individuals interacting with SCP-3145 are unable to provide any details about its identity to third parties, even with application of mnestics. All that is known about SCP-3145 is that it is an entity not much larger than an average human, that it is sapient and capable of speech, and that the designation \"SCP-3145\" can be used to identify it. It is not certain whether SCP-3145 has a physical form, though there does seem to be a movable locus from which its effects originate, with a maximum range limited by what a human with 20/20 vision would be able to easily see from that location.\nHe is nothing.\nSCP-3145 has the ability to permanently alter written narratives by replacing one of the characters, typically the main character, with itself. According to SCP-3145, it lives out the events depicted in these narratives while altering them, and this act gives it a sense of identity that it otherwise lacks. The veracity of this statement cannot be ascertained, as SCP-3145 has been known to feign muteness when it does not wish to interact with personnel, and its presence within its containment chamber generally cannot be fully known.
