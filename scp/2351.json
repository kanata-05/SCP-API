Instances are to have their flight feathers annually clipped to ensure inability to fly. Apart from this, SCP-2351 instances require no containment procedures. For instructions regarding routine care, see Document-2351-D.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2351 is the collective designation of three specimens of adult, female \nBranta canadensis\n, commonly referred to as Canada goose. SCP-2351 specimens (designated SCP-2351-1, -2, and -3 in order of capture) display no behavioral abnormalities, and appear physically indistinguishable from non-anomalous Canada geese save for their effect on human observers.\n\n\nAny human being who visually perceives an instance of SCP-2351 will experience a compulsion to imitate the vocalizations of a Canada goose, maintaining such behavior for as long as they maintain visual contact. Pictures and visual recordings of SCP-2351 do not carry this effect. The mechanism behind SCP-2351\u2019s anomalous nature has yet to be determined.\n\n\nSubjects, including those made aware of SCP-2351\u2019s anomalous properties, will perceive their behavior as voluntary, claiming their actions were performed out of personal amusement. Affected subjects demonstrate an increase in morale following exposure to SCP-2351.\n\n\nSCP-2351-1 and SCP-2351-2 were captured in New York, NY between the dates of July 3 and July 8, 2015. SCP-2351-3 was captured in Albany, NY on July 12, 2015. A detailed timeline may be found in Document-2351-H: Capture and Containment of SCP-2351.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\n\nDuring the capture of SCP-2351-3, a message was found attached by a rubber band to its right leg:\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis B: 780,000\n\nHepatitis A: 350,000\n\nTyphoid Fever: 200,000\n\nMeasles: 145,000\n\n[Crude drawing of what appears to be a large lizard]: 129\n\n[Outline of a humanoid figure with disproportionately large head]: 14\n\n[Detailed pencil drawing of three Canada geese]: 0\n\n\nAre We Cool Yet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2350\n | SCP-2351 | \nSCP-2352\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2351\n\" by Highroller, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
