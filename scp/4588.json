Alternatively, instances may be kept in closed-top glass terrariums. They are to be fed twice a day, using any available organic waste from the Site.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4588 are a group of fifteen currently captured sentient entities, labeled SCP-4588-1 to SCP-4588-15. The instances' physical appearance is identical to that of plastic bags and crumpled paper, found commonly across urban centers and environments. SCP-4588 displays no visible means of locomotion; despite this, SCP-4588 seems to possess the ability to drift and float around environments without any wind currents or outward stimuli.\n\n\nAll known physical appearances of SCP-4588 are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nColored plastic bags of various brands\n\n\nNewspaper issues dating as far back as 19\u2588\u2588\n\n\nTakeout bags and food wraps of various brands\n\n\nLarge colored garbage bags\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4588 instances are extremely docile, and do not seem to react to any non-harmful stimuli. Instead, they will glide across their current habitat in search of food. Instances have been subjected to sub-zero temperatures, and will reanimate upon reaching any temperature above 0\u00b0C, resuming their seemingly aimless travel. As an instance cools down, its movement will gradually slow, and the instance will crumple itself up, before ceasing all movement. Instances show surprising flexibility despite their frozen state, and can be further crumpled and unraveled without tearing or breaking apart. Conversely, when heated, instances speed will increase, and if given the opportunity, will seek to escape the source of heat. This is theorized to be a form of self-preservation, as SCP-4588 has shown a susceptibility to fire\n1\n.\n\n\nSCP-4588 instances have been observed to reproduce asexually. However, the method through which reproduction is achieved remains unknown. An instance will separate itself from others, usually into a corner or other enclosed area, and will slowly crumple into a small ball. After a varying length of time\n2\n, the instance will slowly unravel, a smaller instance of SCP-4588 rolling out of it, and immediately displaying behavior similar to that of other SCP-4588 instances. The appearance of the newly birthed instance will vary greatly, and no known pattern to the physical appearance of newborn instances has been observed. In 80% of cases, the newborn SCP-4588 measures at approximately half the size of its parent instance, and will grow to maturity over a period of 36 hours, at the end of which becoming identical in size to its parent instance.\n\n\nAttempts to dissect and observe SCP-4588's anatomy have provided inconclusive results. All dissected instances of SCP-4588 have shown no anomalous qualities, and appear to be made of standard paper, plastic, and ink, dependent on the material they currently replicate.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-4588 do not require water and can go for extended periods of time in extreme conditions with little to no food source. The longest recorded period being approximately seventy-two days, after which the instance ceased all movement and lost all anomalous properties, presumably becoming deceased. The entities feed by enveloping small objects with their body, completely wrapping the object in an airtight seal, and consuming them instantaneously. No trace of the object is left behind, and instances have not shown a preference between rotting or fresh foods. It is to be noted that the entities can only consume objects that which they can fully surround, as they seem to be unable to consume things partially.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-4588 have also been observed to \"taste test\" new and unusual objects that they come across in different environments. Once an unfamiliar object is noticed by the entity, it will float over to it and form its airtight seal on the object, before unwrapping and resuming its flight if it finds the object to be inedible. Human subjects that have had their extremities go under this process have described the feeling similar to that of being tickled, and zero cases have shown an instance consuming any contacted parts of the subject. This, paired with SCP-4588's extremely docile nature, \nmakes it of little threat to humans and other large living organisms\n3\n.\n\n\nSCP-4588 was initially discovered on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2016 when a Field Agent noticed a paper bag blowing across a road in the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The bag drifted toward a flock of pigeons and wrapped itself around a lone bird, leaving behind zero trace of the creature. The bag then continued to float down the street, showing no signs of the bird being captured inside the bag. The instance was swiftly and easily detained by the agent soon after, and brought to the Foundation for containment. All agents assigned to urban environments are to carefully observe any airborne trash they come across, due to the possibility of a stray instance of SCP-4588.\n\n\nAddendum 4588.1:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2017, D-45881 was instructed to enter a temporary containment chamber, with all recovered instances of SCP-4588 inside. D-45881 was instructed to capture an instance, and attempt to ignite it with the matches provided to him. Upon catching an instance and striking the match, the instance appeared to show distress, and attempted to tear itself free of D-45881's grip. Upon ignition, the instance let out a high-pitched squeal, and burned up in approximately 3 seconds. At the sound of the scream, all other instances of SCP-4588(34 at the time) ceased aimless drift and began to soar towards D-45881, beginning to cover his body entirely. D-45881 was soon overwhelmed by the instances, and was unable to remove them from himself. After approximately 3 minutes of struggle, D-45881 became completely enveloped in SCP-4588 instances. D-45881 was then presumably consumed by the instances, as they began to disperse from D-45881's last known location, leaving no trace of him behind.\n\n\nInstances were observed to be unusually hostile towards all personnel entering the temporary containment cell for approximately 24 hours after this event, attempting to envelop personnel entering the chamber similarly to D-45881. Instances continue to show hostility and fear towards individuals who come into proximity with a box of matches or items similar in appearance.\n\n\nSince this event, SCP-4588 instances have also been limited to fifteen in their containment lockers at any time, additional instances spawned are to be incinerated in a separate cell to prevent possible events.\n\n\nAddendum 4588.2:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2018, authorities in the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were alerted to a disappearance of a child by his father. Upon arriving on the scene, the father who had called in appeared to be in hysterics while clutching a large plastic garbage bag in his hands. After being calmed down, the man was taken in for questioning and gave the following interview.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Field Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 under the pseudonym of Police Officer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nForeword:\n Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was brought in for questioning at the nearest police station immediately following the incident, and was allowed adequate time to attempt to gather himself before giving a statement.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nOfficer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Alright Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, could you please tell me the sequence of events that led to your son's disappearance?\n\n\nMr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Yes, yes, alright.

And he wasn't there. He was [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] gone. My son. My pride and joy, [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] gone in the blink of an eye. I looked through that bag, again and a-again. B-But he was gone.

SCP-4588 displays no visible means of locomotion; despite this, SCP-4588 seems to possess the ability to drift and float around environments without any wind currents or outward stimuli.",
