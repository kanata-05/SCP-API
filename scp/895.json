No cameras, microphones, or other surveillance equipment may be brought within the 10 meter \"Red Zone\" radius of SCP-895 without express permission from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel.\n\n\nAny on-site personnel exhibiting unusual behavior or signs of psychological trauma are to be screened immediately, and removed from the site or terminated as the situation warrants.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-895 is an ornate oak coffin recovered from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mortuary by SCP personnel on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588, following reports of unusual footage captured by surveillance equipment installed at that location. When questioned, mortuary staff were unable to determine the source of SCP-895 and how it was transported to the location. Upon attempting to open SCP-895, agents on location found the object empty; however, observers viewing the live camera feed were [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until further notice, SCP-895 must remain closed at all times.\n\n\nSCP-895 causes disruptions in video and photographic surveillance equipment within 50 meters similar to vivid, disturbing hallucinations with variable duration and regularity corresponding to the camera's proximity to SCP-895. Within a range of 5 meters from SCP-895, footage captured can cause severe psychological trauma and hysteria in most subjects. These disruptions do not extend to observers physically present within the area.\n\n\nAddendum 895-01:\n Audio excerpt from the SCP-895 Recovery Log (\u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588)\n\n\n\n\n03:41L - \nCommand:\n Team One, Command.
