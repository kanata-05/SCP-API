SCP-3492 can be supplied with rewards in return for compliance. SCP-3492 must be fed a standard regimen of three meals each day.\n\n\nStaff are advised to exhibit caution while in proximity with SCP-3492, as the spatial distortions it experiences may cause unintentional harm to nearby individuals.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3492 is a Caucasian male human claiming to be named \"dicks mcSquigee\".\n1\n DNA analysis has proven inconclusive, as collected samples are subject to microscale replications of the entity\u2019s properties, and will spontaneously demanifest after indeterminate periods of time.\n\n\nSCP-3492 sporadically undergoes prominent spatial and/or temporal distortions centralised upon random portions of the entity\u2019s body. These distortions vary in duration and content, but typically involve one of or multiple of the following:\n\n\n\n\nDislocation of bodily portions\n2\n to another fixed position relative to the remainder of SCP-3492;\n\n\nOver or underexaggerated movement of bodily portions along a single axis, frequently resulting in the above;\n\n\nOver or underexaggerated rotation of jointed limbs, frequently to physically impossible extents;\n\n\n(Supposed) rotation or movement of bodily portions along or around unobservable, higher spatial dimensions;\n\n\nSpontaneous loss of one or more spatial dimensions, resulting in SCP-3492 converting into a lower-dimensional form;\n\n\nProminently slowed or accelerated motion of bodily portions;\n\n\nApparent motion of limbs independently from SCP-3492;\n\n\nMotion of bodily portions occurring in an inverted manner;\n\n\nPseudo-precognitive abilities resulting from SCP-3492 briefly undergoing a period of inverted time.\n\n\n\n\nOf note is that affected portions of SCP-3492 appear to be selectively intangible to the remainder of the entity, enabling limbs to pass through other limbs unaffected, and enabling joints to rotate freely upon all axes while affected. Because of this, SCP-3492 does not suffer from injuries related to its effects, but does experience discomfort.\n\n\nSCP-3492 claims its properties stem from the fact it is a component of a partially-functional program developed by the \nTotleighSoft corporation\n as a proof-of-concept intended to promote interest in a physics engine being developed. The entity's respective instance of this program (designated SCP-3492-A) has yet to be recovered.\n\n\nSCP-3492 was recovered during the 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo, wherein it was attending as part of, and maintaining, an exhibition booth catalogued to be reserved for the TotleighSoft corporation. All attending civilians that observed SCP-3492 prior to recovery were amnestised.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-3492\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Good afternoon, 3492.
