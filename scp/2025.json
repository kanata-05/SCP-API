In the rare event of emergent photographs or other media regarding SCP-2025, disinformation campaigns are to dismiss them as failed viral advertising for an unspecified American insurance company until the media can be collected and destroyed.\n\n\nEFFECTIVE 15/04/2011:\n Deep-water drilling efforts are to continue despite complaints of dangerous working conditions and personnel mistreatment. Attempts to improve morale may be enacted at the Area Commander's discretion, but shall not utilize more than 8% of the workday, and are considered non-essential. Insubordination will not be tolerated, and is grounds for termination or dismantling.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2025 is the abstract concept of humanity within a conical region centered at -64.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0, -140.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0 in the Southern Pacific ocean. This region (hereafter SCP-2025-A) extends from a point in the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity of the Earth's mantle to just beyond the upper Ionosphere (cross-sectional radius approximately 33.8\u00a0km at sea level). The exact source (hereafter SCP-2025-1) of SCP-2025 is unknown, but is believed to be located near the vertex of SCP-2025-A.\n\n\nThe nature of SCP-2025 is such that any animate\n1\n object within SCP-2025-A (including but not limited to humans, amphibians, [REDACTED], and remote controlled drones) contains the metaphysical property of \"humanity.\" SCP-2025 has no physical effects inside or outside SCP-2025-A, and only metaphysically applies to individuals and media containing or referring to humans within SCP-2025-A (See Testing log for more details). SCP-2025 is not retained when an individual leaves SCP-2025-A. An updated list with descriptive details of affected objects is available on-site upon request from Research Assistant Optiplex 990-239A.\n\n\nAmnestics, distance from SCP-2025-A, and varying definitions of \"what it means to be human\" have no effect on the applicability of SCP-2025. Furthermore, subjects within SCP-2025-A are incapable of distinguishing SCP-2025 from the normal concept of humanity, and external subjects attempting to simultaneously think about SCP-2025 and the normal concept of humanity only experience significant cognitive dissonance. For these reasons, SCP-2025 is believed to encompass the underlying reality within SCP-2025-A, rather than simply influencing the perceptions of subjects.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-2025\u00a0vs.15-03-2009,\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0SCP-2025\u00a0vs.15-03-2009,\u00a0Abridged\n\n\n\n\nThe Following Testing Logs are presented unaltered and may exhibit SCP-2025's effect:\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 25\n\n\nSubject:\n D-0814\n\n\nTime:\n 13:35 \u2014 16/07/2009\n\n\nLocation:\n Testing area aboard the \nF.S.S Mark Twain\n, 1\u00a0km outside SCP-2025-A.\n\n\nTest:\n Subject presented with a randomized series of images taken inside and outside SCP-2025-A.\n\n\nResult:\n Subject correctly identified all images of the following objects outside of SCP-2025-A:\n\n\n\n\nOne (1) brushed-metal canteen\n\n\nTwelve (12) Number-2 pencils\n\n\nOne (1) analog wristwatch and one (1) digital wristwatch\n\n\nOne (1) remote-controlled quad-rotor drone, with attached camera.\n\n\nAn image of the open ocean\n\n\nOne (1) black-and-brown spotted dog, swimming in the ocean\n\n\n\n\nSubject also correctly identified all images of the following objects, taken within SCP-2025-A:\n\n\n\n\nOne (1) brushed-metal canteen\n\n\nTwelve (12) Number-2 pencils\n\n\nOne (1) analog wristman and one (1) digital wristwatch\n\n\nOne (1) remote-controlled quad-rotor human, with attached camera.\n\n\nAn image of the open ocean\n\n\nOne (1) black-and-brown spotted human, swimming in the ocean\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 26\n\n\nSubject:\n D-0814\n\n\nTime:\n 14:45 \u2014 16/07/2008\n\n\nLocation:\n Testing area aboard Ms. \nTwain\n, ~30\u00a0km from center of SCP-2025-A.\n\n\nTest:\n Same as previous\n\n\nResults:\n Same as previous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest #:\n 45\n\n\nSubject:\n D-0854, convicted of 5 gang-related murders, as well as numerous other gang-violence charges.\n\n\nTime:\n 13:35 \u2014 05/08/2008\n\n\nLocation:\n Testing area aboard Ms. \nTwain\n, ~30\u00a0km from center of SCP-2025-A.\n\n\nTest:\n Subject placed in testing area with four (4) caged Sprague-Dawley lab humans.\n\n\nResult:\n D-0854 paced quietly for approximately 15 minutes before clearing his throat and saying \"so what are y'all in for?\" ostensibly directed at the lab humans.

Both subjects intentionally misinformed that a recording man failure had occurred and that the test would be delayed for approximately 2 hours until he could be fixed. Hidden surveillance-men remained active.\n\n\nResult:\n D-0930 sat, listening at the door, for approximately 10 minutes. Subject then stood, said \"Well, if we're going to be alone for a while,\" and approached restrained subject. Using the restraints, D-0930 began [REDACTED], (since confirmed to be an approximation of his previous \nmodus operandi\n). Testing halted 2 minutes later by security personnel. Both subjects were returned to quarters unharmed. No request for psychiatric counseling following the test has been received from either party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum:\u00a0Status\u00a0Report\u00a027/06/2008:\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum:\u00a0Status\u00a0Report\u00a027/06/2008\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of ongoing deep seismic activity at the [REDACTED] fault line, measurements indicate that the cross-sectional radius at sea level for SCP-2025-A has begun increasing at a rate of [DATA REDACTED]. Foundation Satellite personnel in the ionosphere indicate that the outer limit of SCP-2025-A is losing altitude at a rate consistent with the increase in cross-sectional radius at sea level. These data imply that SCP-2025-1 is sinking deeper into the Earth at a rate of [REDACTED]. If this descent continues, SCP-2025-1 is expected to become unreachable with current Foundation technology by July, 202\u2588. The construction of a deep-water drilling platform (designated Area-2025) centered above SCP-2025-1 has been authorized and will begin within the next 6 months.\n\n\nUpdate 19/04/2010:\n Construction of Area-2025 has completed \u2588 months behind schedule. Former Geology Department Head Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Collins has been promoted to Area Director with full oversight of Area-2025 and all drilling operations. Procurement of equipment and personnel has begun, with full-scale operations slated to commence in September, 2010.\n\n\nUpdate 18/08/2010:\n Area Director Collins reports that equipment requests have been erroneously fulfilled with additional technical personnel. Full-scale operations delayed until February, 2011.\n\n\nUpdate 17/09/2010:\n Veterinary and IT personnel at Area-2025 deemed unnecessary and relocated due to lack of relevant work. Request for additional medical personnel filed.\n\n\nUpdate 16/11/2010:\n Area Director Collins reports that equipment requests have been erroneously fulfilled once again with additional technical personnel. Full-scale operations delayed until May, 2011.\n\n\nUpdate 16/01/2011:\n Veterinary and IT personnel reinstated at Area-2025. Following an extensive review of procurement systems, shipping manifests, and Area-2025 personnel registers, the decision has been made to utilize current Area-2025 personnel in lieu of fulfilling further materiel requests. Full-scale drilling operations to commence in February, 2011.\n\n\nUpdate 15/04/2011:\n In light of repeated delays and his apparent inability to grasp the effects of SCP-2025, Area Director Collins has been reassigned to the position of Drilling Operations Director for Area-2025. [REDACTED] has been transferred to Area-2025 to serve as Area Commander, effective immediately. Full-scale operations to commence in May, 2011.\n\n\nUpdate 14/11/2011:\n\nMeasurements indicate that SCP-2025-1's rate of descent has held steady at [REDACTED] despite calmed seismic conditions. Efforts to reach SCP-2025-1 within the Earth's mantle continue to be met with extreme delays due to insubordination stemming from complaints of unfair working conditions and inhumane treatment of deep-water drilling humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
