Emergency drainage systems are to be maintained at all times, and must possess no fewer then eight filtration screens.\n\n\nSCP-791 is to be held in a wide-weave steel mesh bag, to allow for ease of location in a \u201cDraining\u201d event, and to pre-contain any biological events. Removal from the bag may only be done under testing conditions.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-791 appears to be a mass of liquid water held in a spherical shape by an unknown and undetectable force. Biological tissues can pass through SCP-791 as they would through normal water, and reports indicate the water to be similar to normal sea water, but with a lower salt content. It is impossible to \u201csplash\u201d SCP-791, however, water may be drawn out via the hands or mouth.\n\n\nSCP-791 reacts to non-biological materials, such as stone or metal, as if it were a sphere of solid concrete. SCP-791 may be lifted, rolled, or otherwise manipulated in this way, but acquiring samples with non-biological materials is extremely difficult due to the extreme hardness and weight of SCP-791. SCP-791 does not reduce in dimensions when water is drawn from it. This is true even when withdrawing very high volumes of water.\n\n\nThe water of SCP-791 is sterile, and contains no microbes of any kind. It is almost identical to earth water, but has a slightly elevated amount of hydrogen. SCP-791 will randomly undergo \u201cDraining\u201d events, where massive amounts of water will pour from SCP-791. SCP-791 retains its properties during these events, and \u201cDraining\u201d can last between several hours to four months.\n\n\nItems will sometimes exit SCP-791. It is unknown where these items originate from, though most appear to be \u201coceanic\u201d in origin. Items resembling seaweed, fish, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, plankton, [DATA EXPUNGED] note possible awareness.\n\n\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-like entities have occurred multiple times, and have [DATA EXPUNGED] unknown. Communication via \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and similar alternate realities observed via \nSCP-2684\n, \nSCP-3374\n or indirectly through \nSCP-257\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-790\n | SCP-791 | \nSCP-792\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-791\n\" by Dr Gears, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
