Retiring Foundation personnel with relevant experience\n1\n are strongly encouraged to take up residence in Negaseattle following their retirement in order to assist the initiative. Individuals 5132-1 through 5132-50 are to be kept within the bounds of Negaseattle and approved Foundation properties and locations.\n2\n Further details regarding the treatment of Individuals 5132-1-50 can be found in the Initiative Comprehensive Guide written by Dr. Clark.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5132 refers to the operation being conducted in the Foundation retirement town of Negaseattle, Washington. SCP-5132 is designed to combat the observed drop in personnel over the course of the late 20th and early 21st century. Due to the Foundation\u2019s increasingly concerning turnover rates, measures were approved by the O5 Council to ensure the retention of the current leadership as of 1981. Fifty individuals, ranging from Mobile Task Force commanders to Site Directors to leaders of specific projects, were chosen for the initial trial run. These individuals were tested for prominent genetic defects and pervasive medical history before submitting a DNA sample to create a genetic clone. To date, three viable clones of each individual (and thus four generations of the selected individuals) have been produced using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, each employing different methods of ensuring the best outcome for the Foundation\u2019s needs.\n\n\nOverview: \nRose Hatcher\n, Individual 5132-32\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual 5132-32.1\n\n\nIndividual 5132-32.2\n\n\nIndividual 5132-32.3\n\n\nIndividual 5132-32.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n Deceased 1992, lung cancer.\n\n\nDesirable Traits:\n Practical creativity, fast reflexes, emotional control.\n\n\nUndesirable Traits:\n Contrarian nature, frequent lack of respect for authority, disorganization, addictive tendencies, genetic history of endometrial cancer.\n\n\nNotes:\n Doctorates in physics and engineering.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Date:\n 3/12/1981\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Rose Hatcher\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. John Cataldo\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n Again, we\u2019d like to thank you for participating in this project.\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n Thank you for including me.

What would you say is your favorite childhood memory?\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n When I was nine, my father took me to LegoLand and let me shovel whatever Legos I liked into a bucket. Best day of my life.\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n Really the best toy. What is your deepest intangible fear?\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n That people won\u2019t listen to me in emergencies, and it\u2019ll result in people getting hurt.\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n Understandable. And if you had to rate your loyalty to the Foundation on a scale of one to five, where do you think you would fall?\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n Three.\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n Could you elaborate on that?\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n I\u2019m more loyal to things like my family than I am to my place of work. I\u2019m perfectly happy to do my duty that I\u2019m paid for, but I think it\u2019s no surprise that I take issue with the way things are run around here.\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n Right. That concludes our interview, Dr. Hatcher, thank you again for coming in.\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n How\u2019s it going?\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n I\u2019m sorry?\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n The project. 5132.\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n It\u2019s\u2026 we\u2019ve encountered a few hitches we weren\u2019t expecting.\n\n\nDr. Hatcher:\n Stuff you can fix in the next go-round.\n\n\nDr. Cataldo:\n Probably.

But while I'm glad you're thinking compassionately, I need to remind you that your position on this project does not include research into SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 or any other Foundation project. While all the diseases observed in the subjects are indeed non-anomalous, using any anomaly for cancer research would be an improper use of Foundation resources and could cause vastly more problems than it would solve.\n\n\nFurthermore, I would like you to think about the importance of this project. The Foundation is approaching its twilight if we don't find a solution. We are hemorrhaging personnel at an unsustainable rate. The 5132 project has the potential to save our organization if we can stay focused on the task at hand.\n\n\nDr. Cannon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirth Date:\n 1986\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n Deceased 2012, gunshot wound.\n\n\nDesirable Traits:\n Fast reflexes, emotional control, logical thinking, high Foundation loyalty.\n\n\nUndesirable Traits:\n Inclination toward social isolation, lack of compassionate empathy, unpredictable impulsivity, chronic depression, self-destructive behavior.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Individual 5132-32.3\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Katharine Clark\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n Good morning, Miss Hatcher.\n\n\n5132-32.3:\n 32.3.

Raising them within the Foundation, starting their training as early as possible, limiting their connection to the outside world, I understand why we are doing it. They are not ordinary children, they will not have ordinary lives. The course they have set ahead of them is, by design, extremely difficult and high-pressure, and they need to be introduced to that early. They aren't even human, strictly speaking. We still are not 100% on any side effects produced long-term by the anomaly that created them.\n\n\nBut as I'm watching them, monitoring their health and progress, I'm having major doubts about how we have set this up.\n\n\nTheir development is normal, comparatively. Maybe it's only been a dozen years, but none of them are showing anything abnormal in the timeline of their development. They have shown, however, signs of progressively severe mental problems. A morbid part of me thinks maybe it's beneficial in the long run, given that most Foundation employees end up with some kind of mental illness anyway. But another part of me is still dubious of our plan to raise children in an underground military bunker, for their sake.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this project isn't about what's best for them. It's about what's best for all of us. We've already botched one phase. We are running out of chances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirth Date:\n 2010\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n Active, currently in care of Dr. Elaine Marten and former special agent Griffith Hook.\n\n\nDesirable Traits:\n Practical creativity, high motivation, strong social skills, fast reflexes, Foundation loyalty.\n\n\nUndesirable Traits:\n Contrarian nature, impulsivity, disorganization, willful attitude.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Date:\n 12/9/2026\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Rose Hatcher 4\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Clark\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n How are you feeling, Rosie?\n\n\nHatcher:\n Pretty good.

Gotta keep up that rep.\n\n\n[Dr. Clark laughs]\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll still be the coolest. Okay, what would you say is your favorite childhood memory?\n\n\n[Hatcher thinks for a moment]\n\n\nHatcher:\n Umm, tie between when Griff got me that robot kit when I was little and that one time me and Rai snuck out after curfew and \nshot off fireworks inside that gross old water tower outside of town.\n[\n4\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n \u2026I uh, I remember being briefed on that second one, actually!\n\n\nHatcher:\n Oh, yeah, we got in big trouble for that. They were BIG mad.\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n Well, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re both alright. Okay, Rosie, if you had to rate your loyalty to the Foundation on a scale of one to five, where do you think that would be?\n\n\nHatcher:\n Um, five.\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n That's good to hear!\n\n\nHatcher:\n But- I dunno. Of course I want to do what I can to fix everything. I know that's why I'm here, but like\u2026 I could really use more of a break sometimes? They push us pretty hard. Not that that's a bad thing! It's just a lot sometimes. Am I rambling?\n\n\nDr. Clark:\n No, I see what you mean.

The board has observed subpar marks from over half the subjects. This memo is a reminder of our goal with this project and the importance of our work here. The initiative is committed to providing the optimal environment for the rearing and education of children, and any subjects not meeting their objectives in mental and physical areas needs their system reevaluated by their caretakers until they can properly meet our standards.\n\n\nTeam, do not forget that these are not just children. They are our last chance. They are the future of the Foundation. I cannot stress enough that should Phase 3 fail, we do not get another shot. You're encouraged to speak to your charges about the importance of their position if you think that will motivate them to work harder.\n\n\nThe children are the future, everyone.

Dr. Clark: Really? 5132-32.3: The Foundation raised me. Where else would I have to go? Dr. Clark: \u2026oh. [Several seconds of silence pass] Dr. Clark: Yeah. Okay. Uh- that concludes this interview, Ms. Hatcher. Any parting thoughts? 5132-32.3: None, thanks. Dr. Clark: Alright. <End Log>",
        "Oct. 5\u00a01998 I worry about the kids. I understand why we are conducting this phase the way that we are. Raising them within the Foundation, starting their training as early as possible, limiting their connection to the outside world, I understand why we are doing it. They are not ordinary children, they will not have ordinary lives. The course they have set ahead of them is, by design, extremely difficult and high-pressure, and they need to be introduced to that early. They aren't even human, strictly speaking. We still are not 100% on any side effects produced long-term by the anomaly that created them. But as I'm watching them, monitoring their health and progress, I'm having major doubts about how we have set this up. Their development is normal, comparatively. Maybe it's only been a dozen years, but none of them are showing anything abnormal in the timeline of their development. They have shown, however, signs of progressively severe mental problems. A morbid part of me thinks maybe it's beneficial in the long run, given that most Foundation employees end up with some kind of mental illness anyway. But another part of me is still dubious of our plan to raise children in an underground military bunker, for their sake. Unfortunately, this project isn't about what's best for them. It's about what's best for all of us. We've already botched one phase. We are running out of chances.",
        "Interview Date: 12/9/2026 Interviewed: Rose Hatcher 4 Interviewer: Dr. Clark <Begin Log> Dr. Clark: How are you feeling, Rosie? Hatcher: Pretty good. How are you? Dr. Clark: I\u2019m doing alright, thanks for asking. Hatcher: Is this for the clone thing? Dr. Clark: Yeah, it\u2019s for the \u201cclone thing.\u201d How do you feel about your role in this \u201cclone thing?\u201d Any concerns? Hatcher: Um, I get nervous about if I\u2019m living up to the expectation. Dr. Clark: What expectation is that, do you think? Hatcher: The expectation that I\u2019ll keep being the coolest person in the Foundation. Gotta keep up that rep. [Dr. Clark laughs] Dr. Clark: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll still be the coolest. Okay, what would you say is your favorite childhood memory? [Hatcher thinks for a moment] Hatcher: Umm, tie between when Griff got me that robot kit when I was little and that one time me and Rai snuck out after curfew and shot off fireworks inside that gross old water tower outside of town. [ 4 Dr. Clark: \u2026I uh, I remember being briefed on that second one, actually! Hatcher: Oh, yeah, we got in big trouble for that. They were BIG mad. Dr. Clark: Well, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re both alright. Okay, Rosie, if you had to rate your loyalty to the Foundation on a scale of one to five, where do you think that would be? Hatcher: Um, five. Dr. Clark: That's good to hear! Hatcher: But- I dunno. Of course I want to do what I can to fix everything. I know that's why I'm here, but like\u2026 I could really use more of a break sometimes? They push us pretty hard. Not that that's a bad thing! It's just a lot sometimes. Am I rambling? Dr. Clark: No, I see what you mean. Alright, last one, what is your deepest intangible fear? Hatcher: That I\u2019ll mess it up. <End Log>",
        "Happy weekend everyone, As you all know, first quarter test scores came in on Monday. The board has observed subpar marks from over half the subjects. This memo is a reminder of our goal with this project and the importance of our work here. The initiative is committed to providing the optimal environment for the rearing and education of children, and any subjects not meeting their objectives in mental and physical areas needs their system reevaluated by their caretakers until they can properly meet our standards. Team, do not forget that these are not just children. They are our last chance. They are the future of the Foundation. I cannot stress enough that should Phase 3 fail, we do not get another shot. You're encouraged to speak to your charges about the importance of their position if you think that will motivate them to work harder. The children are the future, everyone. Good work.",

    "description": "SCP-5132 refers to the operation being conducted in the Foundation retirement town of Negaseattle, Washington. SCP-5132 is designed to combat the observed drop in personnel over the course of the late 20th and early 21st century. Due to the Foundation\u2019s increasingly concerning turnover rates, measures were approved by the O5 Council to ensure the retention of the current leadership as of 1981. Fifty individuals, ranging from Mobile Task Force commanders to Site Directors to leaders of specific projects, were chosen for the initial trial run. These individuals were tested for prominent genetic defects and pervasive medical history before submitting a DNA sample to create a genetic clone. To date, three viable clones of each individual (and thus four generations of the selected individuals) have been produced using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, each employing different methods of ensuring the best outcome for the Foundation\u2019s needs.",
