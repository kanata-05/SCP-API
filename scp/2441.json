Access to SCP-2441 is prohibited except with the express permission of Dr. Chidlow. Any personnel subjected to SCP-2441's anomalous effect are to be administered Class-C amnestics if progression has not advanced to stage 2. Instances of SCP-2441-1 are to be terminated.\n\n\nDescription\n: SCP-2441 is an analog wall clock of standard make and model whose hands appear to be stopped at eight o' clock. However, microscopic analysis of the hands shows the minute and second hand to be constantly approaching the twelve, and the hour hand approaching the eight. Each clock hand moves at a rate of one-half the distance remaining to an eight o' clock reading per hour.\n\n\nAnomalous properties manifest when a live human attempts to read SCP-2441's face with the intention of knowing the current time. The affected individual will undergo an instantaneous mental restructuring pertaining to their ability to perceive time; specifically, the grouping of minutes into hours will become a completely alien concept. No other thought processes appear to be directly affected, and no physical changes have been observed in the brains of affected subjects. Research is ongoing.\n\n\nThe progression of SCP-2441's anomalous effect occurs in three stages.\n\n\nStage 1\n: Subjects will begin to denote the passage of time solely by counting the number of minutes passed after first affected by SCP-2441 with flawless accuracy. When questioned on the topic, all subjects unanimously argue this method to be easier and more precise.\n\n\nStage 2\n: Anywhere from twenty to thirty hours following initial exposure, affected individuals begin to display limited probability-altering capabilities and are reclassified as an instance of SCP-2441-1. Any undesirable event (from the perspective of SCP-2441-1) that can be anticipated is subject to 'postponement'- random occurrences in the vicinity of the future event that cause its occurrence to be set back by variable lengths of time. At this stage, subjects do not appear to initiate or influence these events consciously. From this point onward, the relative length of each postponement event increases gradually until stage 3.\n\n\nStage 3\n: Approximately forty-two hours after initial exposure, instances of SCP-2441-1 gain limited reality-bending capabilities. When confronted with an undesirable task or occurrence, instances of SCP-2441-1 alter reality to 'postpone' it. Ten to twelve hours after the development of reality-bending abilities, instances of SCP-2441-1 are able to repeatedly 'postpone' events for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n+Test\u00a0logs\n\n\n\n\n-Test\u00a0logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 2441-1\n\n\nSubject\n: D-1852\n\n\nSupervising Researcher\n: Dr. Chidlow\n\n\nProcedure\n: D-1852 is fitted with a shock collar set to deliver a non-lethal electrical shock once every thirty minutes. Time since initial exposure: 24 hours.\n\n\nResults\n: D-1852 was administered two shocks over the course of one hour. The collar failed to deliver the third shock at the appropriate time; fifteen seconds after replacement, the collar briefly activated twice due to a circuitry malfunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 2441-2\n\n\nSubject\n: D-1852\n\n\nSupervising Researcher\n: Dr. Chidlow\n\n\nProcedure\n: Prior to test, D-1852 is told that the upcoming test is a meeting with Foundation superiors to discuss release from custody with an indeterminate period of probation. D-1852 is fitted with a new shock collar set to deliver a shock every twenty seconds. Time since initial exposure: thirty-three hours.\n\n\nResults\n: After one shock, the collar ceased functioning. While transporting a replacement collar from storage to the testing chamber, Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 tripped and fell on top of it, rendering the collar inoperable. D-1852 terminated shortly afterwards via gunshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 2441-3\n\n\nSubjects\n: D-5524, D-1242\n\n\nSupervising Researcher\n: Dr. Chidlow\n\n\nProcedure\n: Prior to exposure, D-5524 is given a slow-acting toxin in their morning meal designed to induce the development of brain aneurysms over the course of 72 hours.\n\n\nTesting chamber is equipped with a standard folding chair. D-5524 is instructed to sit, and they comply. D-1242 is given a pistol loaded with rubber bullets, and both are told that it is loaded with standard rounds. D-1242 is instructed to point the gun at D-5524. Time since initial exposure: 70 hours. \nNote: By this point, D-5524 appears to have a near-complete understanding of the abilities imparted by exposure to SCP-2441.\n\n\nResults\n: See \nAudio Log 2441-1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG 2441-1\n\n\n- - - BEGIN LOG - - -\n\n\n(D-1242 points the gun towards D-5524's head.)\n\n\nD-5524\n: I wouldn't do that.\n\n\n\n\nD-1242\n: Shut up.\n\n\nD-5524\n: Go ahead, pal. \nTry\n.\n\n\nD-1242\n: You know what?
