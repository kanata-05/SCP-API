The number of SCP-5140 instances is unclear, but accepted to be over 100 and below 200 at the time of writing. SCP-5140 instances are ectoentropic; when physically exposed to heat of any form, including body heat, they will absorb it without raising their temperature, which rests at approximately 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F). This process usually renders physical contact with SCP-5140 instances fatal. If an individual dies as a result of contact with SCP-5140 instances, their corpse will become another SCP-5140 instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5140.1\n\n\nMISSION RECORD \u2014

ANNUAL 5140 EXPEDITION\n\n\nTEAM IS ARRIVING IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS\n\nHOLD STEADY\n\n\n\n\nA rescue detachment of MTF Delta-14 arrived at Charlie Smith's GPS tracker an hour and thirty-six minutes later. They sighted no unburied SCP-5140 instances on their approach. Smith's body was discovered, lacking the signs typical of a SCP-5140 instance. Autopsy indicates he died from exposure and suffocation due to inadequate oxygen intake. Further investigation indicated his oxygen intake valve was damaged during the ascent to the summit. Bodies of Arnold Hillary and Patrick Edmund were discovered higher up Everest. Hillary died from exposure, while Edmund was found to be an SCP-5140 instance.\n\n\nIt is currently believed that Smith's inadequate oxygen led to him hallucinating SCP-5140 instances blocking their path and destroying their campsite. Hillary's foot was found wedged into a rockfall, likely the source of his immobility.\n\n\nThis incident has been taken into account and supply manifests for future expeditions adjusting accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5140.2\n\n\nFILE UPDATE \u2014 4.25.2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0Click\u00a0to\u00a0confirm\u00a0credentials\u00a0\u25bc\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0Hide\u00a0Addendum\u00a0\u25b2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVENT REPORT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScanner image of Mt.

Such thawing caused a large avalanche at 11:49 local time which moved a large amount of snow off the summit. Lower depth of snow allowed scanning planes to identify significant amount of SCP-5140 instances below the snow. Further excavation revealed SCP-5140 instances form a significant portion of Everest itself.\n\n\nCurrently, it is estimated 45% of Mt. Everest's mass is formed by corpses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\nMore\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRounderhouse's Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPs\n\n\n \n\n\nSCP-638\n \n(+265)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5653\n \n(+92)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTDOC-5495\n \n(+268)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6196\n \n(+145)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5227\n \n(+283)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-7666\n \n(+335)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4355\n \n(+241)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROUNDERHOUSE's Bone Proposal\n \n(+293)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6000\n \n(+1262)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5983\n \n(+417)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-6819\n \n(+496)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4513\n \n(+236)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4161\n \n(+205)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-8916\n \n(+281)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5383\n \n(+312)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTales/GoI Formats\n\n\n \n\n\nDo you like Huey Lewis and the News?\n \n(+82)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Jersey State Police: Case 102-9381-23\n \n(+38)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody, Nobody, Nobody, and Nobody's Encounters with The Man in the White Suit\n \n(+123)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Calendar's Hot Date: Divine Intervention\n \n(+94)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone Prelude: FISHSKIN\n \n(+82)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody's Observations on Rejected Nobody Applications\n \n(+103)\n \n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
