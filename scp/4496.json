SCP-4496 should be stored in its \"robot\" configuration to avoid accidentally triggering its anomalous properties. Foundation web crawlers are to monitor internet traffic for activity under the username \"MxMaster\".\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4496 is a \nBeast Wars: Super Lifeform Transformers\n action figure representing the character \u30e9\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc (\"Randy\"), produced exclusively for Japanese markets. The toy, as with its non-anomalous counterparts, is built around a primary gimmick of converting from a representation of an organic wild boar (\nSus scrofa\n) to a bipedal \"robot\" with the use of a spring-loaded trigger. SCP-4496 is anomalously durable compared to other \"Randy\" action figures, lacking the excess fragility that typically characterizes the toys.\n1\n\n\nSCP-4496's active anomalous effects manifest when its spring-loaded transformation is triggered. On conversion to its robot form, intermolecular forces within approximately 4.550 meters of SCP-4496 will be instantaneously and significantly weakened, rendering solid matter significantly more brittle and liable to crumble or tear under pressure. This effect is a permanent, one-time alteration of the surrounding molecules rather than an ongoing effect; other matter surrounding SCP-4496 after its conversion into \"robot\" will not be affected, and transforming it back to \"boar\" form will have no impact on matter it has previously affected.\n\n\nGases and liquids are also affected; while liquids will be subject to a reduction in surface tension, there is little practical effect on gases due to their already-weak intermolecular force. However, testing has shown SCP objects of anomalous durability or fragility to be unaffected by the effect.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4496 was initially discovered by Agent Para of MTF Rho-40 (\"Toys 'R' Us Kids\") during routine surveillance of the dealer room at the 2004 Official Transformers Collectors' Convention in Rosemont, Illinois, after its activation during purchase from a dealer table caused the collapse of two tables and severe injury to the buyer.\n\n\nSubsequent interrogation of the seller, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, revealed that he was aware of SCP-4496's anomalous properties, having broken his right arm and leg as well as several other rare items in his Transformers toy collection after triggering it; he had been attempting to sell the toy purely out of desire to not be around it any more. The Foundation took SCP-4496 into custody, and administered amnestics and medical treatment to both Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the purchaser, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, under the pretext of both men having undiagnosed osteoporosis. Convention organisers 3H Productions disseminated a Foundation cover story about a damaged table that collapsed and injured Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Collected Data\n\n\nThe following data consists of interactions made through both the Usenet newsgroup alt.toys.transformers and private emails, and was taken from Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's personal computer.\n\n\n\n\nPost by KillerPunch in alt.toys.transformers thread \"Dealing with \"GOLD PLASTIC SYNDROME\"\", February 7, 2004\n\nOn my way to completing my BWN collection - just picked up the Randy and Crazybolt 2pack - but i'm worried about \"Gold Plastic Syndrome\". How to best make sure Randy doesn't shatter whenever i pick him up? Don't want to have to hunt down a new one.\n\n\n\n\n[EXTRANEOUS POSTS REMOVED]\n\n\n\n\nPost by MxMaster\n2\n in alt.toys.transformers thread \"Dealing with \"GOLD PLASTIC SYNDROME\"\", February 9, 2004\n\nhey man i can help you out, i know a guy whose taught me plenty of tricks for this stuff. if you mail randy to me i can treat him and send him back to you . hell be solid as a rock. send me an email \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588@aol.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost by KillerPunch in alt.toys.transformers thread \"Dealing with \"GOLD PLASTIC SYNDROME\"\", February 9, 2004\n\nSent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588@yahoo.com\n\nTo: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588@aol.com\n\nSent: February 9, 2004\n\nSubject: GPS fixes\n\nI didn't know what to think about this, but figured \"what have I got to lose?
