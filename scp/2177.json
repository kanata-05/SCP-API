Infections have been identified in 17 institutions, including \u2588\u2588 academic libraries, \u2588 private collections, and the former non-classified public library of Site 11\n1\n.\n\n\nInfected institutions are to be infiltrated by at least two Level-2 personnel in supervisory positions, including at least one containment specialist with training in library/information science. SCP-2177 infections are to be quarantined in restricted collections or secure archives not open to the public. In order to avoid Alpha events, new instances of SCP-2177-1 must be shelved according to existing institutional policies. No attempt should be allowed to remove SCP-2177 infections from these institutions. Civilians exposed to SCP-2177-1 are to be detained and administered Class C amnestics.\n\n\nIn order to avoid Beta events, Regional Directors have been authorized to provide financial and political support required to keep infected institutions in operation. If a Beta event is unavoidable, \nMobile Task Force Alpha-4 (\"Pony Express\")\n is to intercept all deliveries of documents to vulnerable institutions and seize SCP-2177-1 instances until such time as a suitable institution can be infiltrated and infected.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2177 is a virus-like pathogen that targets libraries holding print subscriptions to large numbers (> 50) of technical journals. SCP-2177 takes the form of documentation requesting that a journal or document be added to the institution\u2019s collection. This request is always in the correct format for the receiving institution, and occasionally includes misinformation suggesting a pre-existing record. Once SCP-2177 has been entered into the catalog in any capacity, its record is altered to indicate an ongoing subscription to a technical journal. This facilitates reproduction, with new instances of SCP-2177-1 arriving amongst existing subscriptions. Reproduction rates range from 1 item every three months to 1 item per month\n2\n.\n\n\nSCP-2177-1 refers to the viral envelope of SCP-2177, which always takes the form of a 24 x 30\u00a0cm technical journal bound in yellow pasteboard. SCP-2177-1 always contains the SCP-2177 pathogen, although in advanced infections this may only consist of a tailored address label. SCP-2177-1 contents and findings are not anomalous, but always refer to large-scale unethical testing on human subjects. (Sample contents of SCP-2177-1 are available in Addendum 2177-01.)\n\n\nAlpha events occur when infected institutions intentionally discard new instances of SCP-2177-1, attempt to physically remove all SCP-2177-1 instances, or attempt to eliminate SCP-2177 from the catalog. SCP-2177 infections have been shown to adapt to these threats in the following ways:\n\n- Drastically increasing reproduction rates (up to 1 item per week).\n\n- Subdividing to multiply reproduction (e.g dividing a title into Series A, B, and C)\n\n- Creating additional instances of infection under other titles and technical fields.\n\n\nBeta events occur when an SCP-2177 infection is successfully eliminated or when an infected institution ceases operation. In Beta events, SCP-2177 will be transmitted to other vulnerable libraries until at least one institution becomes infected. Transmission vectors include any shipment of documents to a library, including returned materials and large donations. SCP-2177 will initially target institutions with names or street addresses superficially similar to the previously-infected institution, but these criteria become less strict as transmission time increases.\n\n\nAddendum 2177-01: Sample contents of SCP-2177-1\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Archive\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\n\n\nSubject matter:\n\n\nPublication date:\n\n\nExample article:\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\nSubject matter:\n Military aviation\n\n\nPublication date:\n May 1947\n\n\nExample article:\n Effective kill radius of 550-lb (sic) aerial bombs.\n\n\nFindings:\n Detailed explanations of anatomical effects based on human subjects restrained at various distances from a static ground explosion.
