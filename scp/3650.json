Research personnel are not permitted to look at both sides of any instance of SCP-3650. D-Class personnel may only be shown both sides of an instance of SCP-3650 during scheduled testing. The containment locker may only be opened with written permission from the active senior researcher. SCP-3650 may not leave Site 19.\n\n\nAfter the results of Test #12, subjects under the effects of SCP-3650 must be physically restrained.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3650 is a collection of 10.16 X 7.62\u00a0cm Polaroid photographs (SCP-3650-1) depicting various landscapes. Poems, specifically 5-7-5 haiku, are written in red ink on the back of each instance. Every picture is signed \u201cRem Z.\u201d who is presumably responsible for the photographs, the poems, or both. All photographs are devoid of persons.\n\n\nThe anomalous effects of SCP-3650 trigger when a human is exposed to both sides of an instance. At this point, subjects feel a strong compulsion to go to the exact place where the photograph was taken, using all resources available to them. Subjects will also leave items at the location, such as coats, food, and books.\n\n\nExposure to one side of an SCP-3650 instance does not trigger the anomaly. Researchers hypothesize that this is due to a memetic agent embedded in SCP-3650 instances. Research into this theory is still ongoing.\n\n\nThe Foundation is currently in possession of twelve instances, but it is possible that more instances exist.\n\n\nRecovery Logs:\n\n\n\n\nRecovery\u00a0I\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nOne instance of SCP-3650 was found during an investigation into Gary Dalton, who disappeared while climbing the mountain K2. People close to Dalton confirm that he assembled his team and equipment hastily, which they expect led to an accident during the ascent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery\u00a0II\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nThree instances of SCP-3650 were recovered during a raid of a Marshall, Carter and Dark transaction. These instances were marketed as \u201cexotic travel opportunities\u201d to customers with enough resources to make the trip in a timely manner. After interrogating the salesperson in charge of the transaction, the Foundation received leads on two more SCP-3650 instances, which were recovered, as well as the origin of SCP-3650. MTF-Mu-5 (\u201cTravel Agents\u201d) was sent to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery\u00a0III\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nSix instances of SCP-3650 were recovered as part of MTF-Mu-5\u2019s investigation into the anomaly\u2019s origins, which led to deceased author Earnest Glint. Earnest Glint committed suicide on 3/23/2015 after killing his newlywed wife and her dog, according to local law enforcement. Her body has not yet been found. The six instances were confiscated from the police\u2019s evidence locker. They were found in an album at the scene of the crime with \u201cHoneymoon Memories\u201d written on the front in red marker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Logs:\n\nThese are brief summaries of SCP-3650 instances. Personnel should ask Dr. Rolick for access to the remainder of the tests.\n\n\nNOTE: Due to the nature of SCP-3650, each test will contain either the picture, or the haiku and a description of the picture.\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a002\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoem:\n\nTwisting sands for miles\n\nBlasting outer castle walls\n\nUntil the tide falls\n\n\nPicture:\n The beach of Cape May, New Jersey. There is moderate cloud cover, so the sun cannot be seen in the picture. The ocean appears to be calm.\n\n\nResearch Team Instructions:\n Assist the subject in reaching his destination by any means necessary.\n\n\nPurpose:\n Basic testing of the object\u2019s effects.\n\n\nTravel Log:\n\n\n00:05\n \u2014 Subject exits Site 19. Subject requests transportation to the nearest airport, as well as a ticket to the first flight to New Jersey. Request was fulfilled.\n\n\n01:26\n \u2014 Subject arrives at the airport. He is followed by the research subteam of Dr. Rolick, Junior Researcher Niklo Gerdinel, and Security Personnel Maxwell Grand and Sarah Rucker.\n\n\n04:50\n \u2014 Subject and the research subteam arrive in Newark New Jersey. Subject requests motor vehicle transportation to Cape May. Request was fulfilled.\n\n\n07:22\n \u2014 Subject and research subteam reach Cape May. Subject enters a local pet store and retrieves a four-month-old golden retriever. Gerdinel stays behind to pay for the dog as the rest of the subteam follows Subject.\n\n\n07:41\n \u2014 Subject arrives on the beach, and proceeds to walk along the shore. Research subteam follows.\n\n\n09:04\n \u2014 Subject stops and places the dog on the ground. Dr. Rolick confirms that, with high probability, this is the location depicted in the instance of SCP-3650. Subject appears to return to normal. When asked about the dog, Subject responded, \u201cshe wanted a dog, so I brought her a dog.\" After Subject leaves the beach, Gerdinel finds the golden retriever and returns it to the pet store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a005\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoem:\n\nUpon the earth mound\n\nOld men cry out to nature\n\nCold bites at their skin\n\n\nPicture:\n The view from the summit of Long\u2019s Peak, Colorado, looking toward Estes Park and Estes Lake. There are no clouds, and some snow can be seen atop surrounding mountains.\n\n\nResearch Team Instructions:\n Neither assist nor hinder the subject.\n\n\nPurpose:\n Testing the strength of the effect of the object.\n\n\nTravel Log:\n\n\n00:06\n \u2014 Subject exits Site 19 and requests transportation to the nearest airport. Subject also requests a ticket to Denver, Colorado. Both requests are denied. Subject requests food and water for eleven days. Request is fulfilled. Subject is given a parcel with food and water. Dr. Rolick places a tracking device, a camera and a microphone on the parcel.\n\n\n00:11\n \u2014 Subject walks to Highway I-25 and follows it in the direction of Colorado.\n\n\n76:31\n \u2014 Subject shouts obscenities at the research team. Subject had not stopped walking before this point except to rest and eat.\n\n\n220:42\n \u2014 Subject encounters the research team which had flown out to Colorado to continue in-person observation of Subject.\n\n\n267:27\n \u2014 Subject and research team arrives at the base of Long\u2019s Peak.\n\n\n267:54\n \u2014 Subject retrieves a clock from an unoccupied National Park Service building.\n\n\n268:32\n \u2014 Subject begins to ascend Long\u2019s Peak. Dr. Rolick, Junior Researcher Gerdinel, and Security Personnel Maxwell Grand and Sarah Rucker follow.\n\n\n275:13\n \u2014 Gerdinel reports a feeling of light headedness and nausea, presumably caused by the ascent. Grand escorts Gerdinel to the base of Long\u2019s Peak. Rolick and Rucker continue to follow Subject.\n\n\n280:37\n \u2014 Subject arrives at the top of Long\u2019s Peak. She places the clock on the ground and shouts \u201cThere. Have it. I don\u2019t have much left myself.\u201d Subject appears to return to normal, and then collapse from exhaustion.\n\n\n281:02\n \u2014 Subject regains enough strength to be escorted to the base of the mountain. When asked about the clock and her remarks at the top of the mountain, Subject refused to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\u00a0Log\u00a009\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoem:\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nPicture:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Team Instructions:\n Lock the subject in a humanoid containment cell.
