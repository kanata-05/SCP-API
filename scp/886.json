If research is not being undertaken, offspring of both SCP-886-A and SCP-886-B are to be destroyed immediately after birth.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-886 is the collective designation of unique mammals capable of cyclic asexual reproduction. SCP-886-A are identical human females (\nHomo sapiens\n) of Irish descent and SCP-886-B are identical female domestic Irish goats (\nCapra aegagrus hircus\n). Members of SCP-886-A and 886-B develop and behave as expected of ordinary individuals of their species, and are completely ordinary outside their shared anomaly.\n\n\nSCP-886-A-alpha is the oldest and presumably original instance of SCP-886-A. SCP-886-A is a human female, age 37, of average intelligence and stature. Once a year during the spring, SCP-886-A-alpha will spontaneously become pregnant and carry twin instances of SCP-886-B to term. Gestation mirrors that of a standard goat, averaging between 140-160 days.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-886-B will be female, with white fur and of average size. SCP-886-B are friendly and notably docile, having never displayed any form of aggression towards humans during containment. The milk and meat of SCP-886-B may be consumed safely; the anomaly does not appear to be infectious.\n\n\nAt the age of two and a half years, each specimen of SCP-886-B will spontaneously become pregnant, each with a single human infant. Infants born of SCP-886-B are genetically identical to SCP-886-A-alpha, designated SCP-886-A-XX. SCP-886-A-XX will develop as normal human females until age 15, when they will begin to exhibit the anomaly in the fashion previously described.\n\n\nSCP-886-A-alpha does not know how or why she began to exhibit her anomaly, only that it began suddenly and without warning. Similarities between SCP-886 and \nSCP-2910\n have been noted, and investigation into whether SCP-2910 is a variant or altered version of the anomaly seen within SCP-886 is currently ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum - Recovery of SCP-886:\n SCP-886-A-alpha was discovered by embedded Agent Donelly when a local newspaper released a story regarding her anomalous pregnancy in a weekend column. A cover story revealing the column as a piece of short fiction was released and associated civilians were altered appropriately.\n\n\nA task force was called to the area and SCP-886-A-alpha was extracted under the guise of a car accident. Family and friends are being monitored for further anomalies, with special attention paid to the subject\u2019s sisters and daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-885\n | SCP-886 | \nSCP-887\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-886\n\" by Dexanote, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
