SCP-5705 is to be connected to a modified multimeter capable of recording electrical output and messages originating from 'Discharge' events.\n\n\nEquipment is to be checked bi-weekly for damage.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5705 in containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5705 is a standard sized PP3 or 'Nine-Volt' battery with a label attached reading 'Mighty Batteries!\u2122 Powered by Thorium!\u2122' written in black marker. Under normal circumstances, SCP-5705 is capable of an average output of 500\u00a0mA for an indefinite amount of time when connected to an electronic device. SCP-5705 has so far proven to be invulnerable to all forms of damage, however, the label is easily removed. Tests reveal no trace of the radioactivity expected of thorium decay.\n\n\nSCP-5705-1 is an entity currently trapped within SCP-5705. SCP-5705-1 is hostile and actively attempting to escape from the interior of SCP-5705. Occasionally, SCP-5705-1 will enter an agitated state, causing SCP-5705 to undergo what has been designated as a 'Discharge' event. During these events, the overall voltage of SCP-5705 will spike much higher than normal for a short period before returning to it's original output of 500\u00a0mA. If a device with a screen is attached to SCP-5705 during one of these events, text will appear on the screen in a language correlating to the settings of the device. These messages are often corrupted beyond the point of legibility, although a few partially coherent messages have been observed. These messages are believed to originate from SCP-5705-1 and are often hostile in nature, presumably directed at the individual designated as PoI-5705.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-5705-A: Partial List of Recorded Messages\n\n\nNote: The following is a list of all currently recorded 'Discharge' events that have been accompanied by at least partially coherent messages. For a full list of these events, see document SCP-5705-DE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nMessage\n\n\nVoltage\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/04/2020\n\n\n\"I gr&@ow ti*@#&$(@ish game, trickster!

After an investigation into the claims, SCP-5705 was discovered in Bradson's home where it was being used to power a flashlight.\n\n\nBradson claims that he purchased SCP-5705 from a salesman selling his wares on a street corner. A crowd had gathered around to bid on the items being sold, most of which seem to be at least partially anomalous in nature. A number of the individuals had reportedly filmed the salesman, and after further investigation a video of the auction was discovered online.\n\n\nFollowing review of the footage and the items involved, the individual selling the items has been designated as PoI-5705. Investigation into PoI-5705's whereabouts and identity are ongoing.\n\n\nAuction Video Excerpt:\n\n\n\n\n[IRRELEVANT DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nPoI-5705:\n \u2026 pleasure doing business with you and happy sailing! Just remember to not open it indoors. For our next item, we have something that no doubt many of you fine people would love to have yourself!\n\n\nPoI-5705 holds up SCP-5705.\n\n\nPoI-5705:\n This magnificent item is known as a 'Mighty Battery'! On the exterior it may seem to all the world as a simple battery, but with some handiwork by yours truly it has been made into a fountain of limitless energy! Of course there is a limit at how much it can give at one time; we wouldn't want those hippie lobbyists to catch wind of a limitless power supply, would we?\n\n\nThe gathered crowd laughs in response.\n\n\nPoI-5705:\n This fine item will allow you to never worry about a pesky flashlight running out while trekking through the woods! Or an inconvenient halting of particularly\u2026 intimate items? No, this convenient item harnesses godlike power for your own benefit! Hell, I would sell my own brother for this beauty, if I had one that is.\n\n\nPoI-5705 performs an exaggerated wink to the camera, then places SCP-5705 on the table in front of them and throws their hands into the air.\n\n\nPoI-5705:\n So! Let's start the bidding at a measly $15! Any takers?\n\n\nThe crowd begins to bid on SCP-5705, eventually ending with Bradson outbidding the others and purchasing SCP-5705 for a total of $32.50 before returning home. The auction then continues for another hour before PoI-5705 announces his departure and the crowd disperses.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5704\n | SCP-5705 | \nSCP-5706\n \u00bb",
