Believed to have been the site of one of SCP-2354\u2019s first manifestations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2354\n\n\nObject Class:\n Keter\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Lack of knowledge regarding SCP-2354 has made direct containment infeasible.

This policy is to continue until more effective containment procedures can be developed.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2354 is an anomalous ambush predator targeting individuals who have recently experienced the death or disappearance of a loved one.\n\n\nSCP-2354 is believed to stalk a given subject for an extended period of time, variably ranging from three weeks to six months, before luring its target to an isolated location and bludgeoning them to death. SCP-2354 will then lacerate the subject post-mortem, typically by removing a single body part\n1\n. The significance of this process is unknown.\n\n\nBeyond these factors, little is known about SCP-2354\u2019s appearance, movements, or current whereabouts. Although initially attributed to a series of non-anomalous serial killings, the inexplicably broad range of SCP-2354 manifestations has made the likelihood of anomalous influence a near certainty.\n\n\nIncident Log:\n The following is an abridged record of deaths connected to SCP-2354 and descriptions of their circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/15/2002\n\n\nHoward Keitel, 27. Found deceased in a forest one kilometer from his home in Berlin, Germany. Feet removed at the base of the ankles. Bludgeoned to death in accordance with typical manifestation.\n\n\nKeitel\u2019s twelve year old son, Howard Jr., had recently died after falling from the roof of the family's country retreat in Bamberg. Keitel expressed despair over the death, and had recently been hospitalized following a suicide attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8/16/1994\n\n\nKatherine Smith, 33. Found deceased in an alleyway in Trenton, New Jersey, nearly five hundred kilometers from her home in Richmond, Virginia. Believed to have travelled in an attempt to evade SCP-2354. Hands removed. Bludgeoned to death in accordance with typical manifestation.\n\n\nSmith\u2019s twelve month old daughter, Hosanna, had recently died of sudden infant death syndrome. Smith had expressed concerns about childbirth but was described as a loving mother. Reported feelings of being watched prior to death, dismissed as symptoms of an anxiety disorder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/27/1992\n\n\nJose Gonzales, 20. Found deceased in his apartment in Brooklyn, New York. Genitals removed. Bludgeoned to death in accordance with typical manifestation.\n\n\nGonzales\u2019s eight year old niece had recently disappeared in a suspected kidnapping. Gonzales had begun to exhibit strange behaviors shortly after this event, primarily centering around feelings of being watched, which intensified shortly before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/2/1992\n\n\nGeorge Berkowitz, 43. Found deceased in an alleyway three blocks from his home in Los Angeles, California. Hands removed at the base of the wrists. Bludgeoned to death in accordance with typical manifestation.\n\n\nBerkowitz\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Laura Hoover, had disappeared one month prior in what was later ruled a homicide. Her body was discovered shortly before Berkowitz\u2019s death. No suspect was ever identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Most often the hands or genitals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2353\n | SCP-2354 | \nSCP-2355\n \u00bb",
