Each instance is to undergo psychiatric evaluation at least once per year.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1354 is the collective designation for \ntwelve (12)\n eleven (11) 250\u00a0mL volumes of soup stock, designated SCP-1354-1 through -11. Despite their age, instances of SCP-1354 show no signs of spoilage and have proven edible. Additionally, instances of SCP-1354 are exothermic, maintain a constant temperature of 37 degrees celsius and have shown no signs of evaporation.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-1354 are capable of written responses to verbal communication via the manifestation of letter-shaped pasta. Unless otherwise prompted, responses will remain on the surface of SCP-1354 for 3-4 minutes before submerging and vanishing. For interview purposes, instances of SCP-1354 are to remain intact ('intact' defined as maintaining a volume greater than 245\u00a0mL). While removal of less than 5\u00a0mL has no effect on SCP-1354 (and will regenerate within 24 hours), the removal of larger volumes appear to cause confusion, psychosis and incoherent responses in SCP-1354 instances. Attempts at diluting SCP-1354 above 250\u00a0mL with additional fluids result in SCP-1354 \"absorbing\" the additional liquid and maintaining a constant volume.\n\n\nEach instance of SCP-1354 appears to contain the consciousness from one of several dozen individuals reported missing from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Oregon between the dates of 04/07/19\u2588\u2588 and 02/16/20\u2588\u2588. All missing individuals corresponding to instances of SCP-1354 share several characteristics, most notably age (between 30 and 35) and status as the head of a single-parent household (see Interview Log 1354-001). The whereabouts of children of SCP-1354 instances, as well as an additional \u2588\u2588 missing persons believed to correspond to uncontained instances, remain unknown.\n\n\nSCP-1354 was brought to Foundation attention after persistent rumors of \u201ctalking soup\u201d began circulating in local homeless shelters and soup kitchens. Further investigation led to the procurement of this instance as well as a further eleven instances of SCP-1354 obtained during a recent canned food drive. Class B amnestics were administered to all witnesses.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 1354-001\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-1354-1, can you hear me?\n\nSCP-1354-1: YES.
