(\nQuercus alba\n, aka white oak).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-437\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n A fenced perimeter has been established around SCP-437. Foundation horticulturists are to be kept on-site to monitor and care for SCP-437-A instances. Testing is prohibited pending review by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\nMTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\")\n is to investigate all PoIs associated with SCP-437 and place them in Foundation custody along with their children.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-437 is a large grove of trees located in Camp Lakewood, Illinois (USA). It contains 64 instances of SCP-437-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarya ovata\n,\n\naka shagbark hickory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-437-A are numerous trees common to North America. Each instance has several cankers, atypical interior structures (see below), and \u2014 rather than sap \u2014 contains significant quantities of human blood.\n\n\nSCP-437 was discovered by the Foundation in 2011, twenty years after the summer camp's closure. Employment records for Camp Lakewood have not been found. All persons who attended Camp Lakewood during the summer of 1991 are Persons of Interest, and are still currently at large.\n\n\nAddendum 437.1:\n Interview\n\n\nPoI-437-15 was brought in after genetic analysis of blood samples from an instance of SCP-437-A led to a match in Foundation hospital records.\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 2014/09/15\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Agent Bennet\n\n\nSUBJECT:\n PoI-437-15 (Samantha Blanchette)\n\n\n\n\n[\nBEGIN LOG.\n]\n\n\nINTERVIEWER:\n Did you attend Camp Lakewood in 1991?\n\n\nP-15:\n Is that what this is about?
