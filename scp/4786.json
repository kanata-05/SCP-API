They are to be exclusively fed a nutrient paste containing exactly 1,500 calories twice a day. Under no circumstances should they be fed more than 3,200 calories within a 24-hour period.\n\nOnce a week, on a rotating schedule, each individual instance is to be taken to the garden recreational area on level 3 for 60 minutes of exercise.\n\n\nAt no point should any instance be allowed to come into contact with each other or any artifact of Sarkic origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4786-A, c. 1891\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4786 is a collective designation for three nearly-identical humaniform homunculi. Due to their uniformity in appearance, alpha-designation bracelets have been locked around each of their right wrists.\n\n\nEach one stands at 147 centimeters and their weight has been carefully limited to 38.5 kilograms. They possess extensive biological external structures that resemble the traditional court attire of the late Qing dynasty, China. The appearance of their clothing is entirely superficial as the clothing is a biological construct and grows directly out of the homunculus itself.\n\n\nDNA analysis performed on all three instances indicates that they are all identical replicates of a member of the Y-chromasonal Haplogroup C-M130. While they all present with female internal and external sexual organs, their genetic makeup is entirely male. How this was accomplished is currently unknown.\n\n\nAdditionally, magnetic resonance imaging scans reveal that they each contain several anomalous biological internal structures in addition to standard human organs. The function of these organs has not yet been ascertained, though several of them are believed to function as a type of pocket-dimensional \"storage spaces\".\n\n\nEach of the SCP-4786 instances are capable of containing vast quantities of organic matter within these extra organs. Dr. Samira Golzar\n1\n has postulated that while these biological structures point to a Sarkic origin, they represent a level of biological sophistication not currently seen in modern Sarkic carnomancy.\n\n\nThis indicates that any theories about the volume of organic matter currently being \"stored\" within SCP-4786 may be wholly inaccurate.\n\n\n\n\nAttached Addenda\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation regarding SCP-4786 was initially recovered as part of a document-sharing program initiated in September, 1901 between the newly-formed SCP Foundation and the Abnormal Objects and Phenomenon Institute of China (\u4e2d\u534e\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u7269\u4e0e\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4f1a), a Foundation Precursor entity also known as \"The Abnormality Institute (\u5f02\u5b66\u4f1a)\". The Institute had catalogued information about SCP-4786 as \"\u7570\u5b78\u53c1\u96f6\u9678 - \u5a03\u5a03\u6148\u79a7\u592a\u540e\" (Anomaly 306 - Empress Dowager Cixi Doll), but did not have SCP-4786 in custody.\n\nInitial investigation into the whereabouts of SCP-4786 was slowed by the vast quantities of data received by the Foundation during the transfers, and was ultimately put on indefinite hold by Administrative Order O5.ord.62 in August, 1902\n2\n.\n\n\nResearch into SCP-4786 was further hampered by the onset of the First and Second World Wars, and was not officially recommenced until after an inquest into anomalies located in the northern portion of the Korean peninsula was requested by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during treaty negotiations with the Foundation in 1954.\n\n\nA large underground complex was located near the Koguryo Tombs in South Hwanghae Province, DPRK that had been sealed at some point prior to the events that lead to World War II and had not been reopened until the newly-established DPRK government had commissioned a survey of culturally-sensitive sites in the areas they controlled.\n\n\nAccording to records given to the Foundation regarding the initial expedition into the complex, a three-person survey team had been sent in to explore the extent of the complex but had never returned. After six days, a small detachment of soldiers from the Korean People's Army Ground Force was sent in to retrieve the team, but they were also declared lost.\n\n\nIn October of 1954, four months after the lost KPAGF expedition was sent into the LoI-4786 complex, a six man team of the newly formed Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 (\"The Red Right Hand\")\n3\n was sent in to explore the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a04786.doc.01\u00a0-\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0Transcript\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a04786.doc.01\u00a0-\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0Transcript\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration Video Log Transcript\n\n\nDate:\n 1954/10/22\n\n\nAction Team:\n MTF Alpha-1 (\"The Red Right Hand\")\n\n\nOperational directive:\n Explore LoI-4786 & retrieve any data on missing KPAGF operatives.\n\n\nTeam Lead:\n Lt. Maj. Hercule Montserrat, \"Alpha\"\n\n\nForeword:\n \nThe six man team was air lifted to the site via helicopter and spent the initial 23 minutes scouting the area surrounding LoI-4786 before entering the complex via the only located surface entrance. Team member Harold \"Zeke\" Thompkins, \"Zeta\" remained outside to act as a communications relay & reserve support.\n\n\nThe transcript of this initial survey has been omitted for brevity. Video feed is from Major Montserrat's helmet-mounted camera.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Ok, Zeke, we're going in. Keep an ear on us, eh?\n\n\nZeta:\n Sure thing, Major. I got your backs.\n\n\n[Major Montserrat turns towards the opening in the hillside leading into LoI-4786, where the other members of Alpha-1 can be seen. All of them are heavily armed with assault weapons, each fitted with a tactical light which they are currently directing into the opening. As the Major reaches the opening, the light reveals a set of narrow steps descending down into the darkness.]\n\n\nGamma:\n Real inviting, isn't it boss?\n\n\nAlpha:\n Get used to it Harmonds, er, Gamma. This is what we signed up for.\n\n\n[Montserrat looks back in time to see Gamma give him a salute.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n You aren't an American Marine anymore, Gamma. You don't need to keep doing that.\n\n\nGamma:\n Uh, yessir. Hard habit to break.\n\n\nAlpha:\n \n[Grunts in acknowledgement.]\n Ok, Beta, you're in first. I'll follow. Everyone else, you're after me. We have nothing in terms of intel, so keep it tight.\n\n\n[Montserrat nods at Beta and he moves into the tunnel, his light illuminating the first dozen steps ahead before dissipating into the darkness. After several minutes of descending the steps, the tunnel widens into a landing, large enough that the lights from the team fail to illuminate the far side.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Hold. Zeke, can you still hear me?\n\n\nZeta:\n There's some static, but I still got you. This comm equipment is amazing.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Only the best. We descended about 1100 steps down and into the hillside, so we're about 800 meters in, give or take. Tunnel just opened into a massive room. Floor looks to be made of some kind of highly polished marble, and-\n\n\n[He breaks off and the squad around him tenses and begin to pan their weapons about them into the darkness. The only sound is the quiet breathing of the team into their pickup microphones.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Beta, you hear that?\n\n\nBeta:\n Sounds like\u2026 \n[short pause]\n Women talking. Far. To our three o'clock. This place must be huge.\n\n\nZeta:\n I'm not picking up anything but you guys on the radio.\n\n\nAlpha:\n Stand by, Zeke. I'll keep you updated. Beta, take us towards the sound. Epsilon, you're on rear. Delta, you've got left, Gamma you're on right. Move, half pace.\n\n\n[The team falls into formation and begins to slowly make their way through the darkness. After a hundred or so steps, a large wooden structure can be seen in the near distance and the microphones begin to pick up the faint sounds of a female voice talking in an unknown language.]\n\n\nZeta:\n I got it. Is that Korean?\n\n\nEpsilon:\n \n[whispering]\n No. At least, not a Korean I am familiar with. Kim\n4\n has been grumbling about how we have been using the language wrong, but this is definitely not Korean. Mandarin, maybe?\n\n\nGamma:\n \n[whispering]\n Do you speak that, Eps?\n\n\nEpsilon:\n \n[whispering]\n You brought me along to translate Korean, yankee-boy. I do not speak-\n\n\nAlpha:\n \n[whispering]\n Can it. Zeke, you better be recording this.\n\n\nZeta:\n I got it boss. Haven't stopped since you went down there.\n\n\nAlpha:\n \n[whispering]\n Spread out, keep lines of sight clear. Beta, that part looks like a door. Let's see if we can get closer. Everybody else, stay here. Zeke, we've got a large wooden pagoda-like building. Highly ornate carvings along the columns, but everything looks like it's covered in dust.\n\n\n[Montserrat and Beta move forward; Beta pauses before stepping up onto the wooden platform surrounding the structure.]\n\n\nBeta:\n \n[whispering]\n Lots of tracks in the dust. How is this covered in the stuff and the marble isn't?\n\n\n[The woman's voice suddenly cuts off and Alpha makes a 'hold position' with his free hand.]\n\n\nBeta:\n What? Don't you see? There's no one here.\n\n\n[Beta turns to look at the wall before unstrapping his helmet and letting it fall to the ground.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n \n[whispering, louder]\n Beta. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Put your helmet on and get back here. Team, stand by. Zeke, something's up with Beta.\n\n\nGamma:\n No, seriously, boss. I see it too. Those glyphs wouldn't still be here if there was people.\n\n\n[Montserrat turns in time to see Gamma remove his helmet and drop it and his firearm to the ground before stepping up to join Beta on the platform. Montserrat scans the surface of the-]\n\n\n[VISUAL HAZARD CONFIRMED, VIDEO DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Get the fuck back from the building. There's a [DATA EXPUNGED] drawn on the wall. Zeke, we're gonna need more than a six-man team on this. Beta and Gamma are locked in some sort of trance-state and are non-responsive.\n\n\nEpsilon:\n Major, there's movement at the door.\n\n\n[The Major looks back towards the building, blocking part of the view with his upraised hand. Two of the SCP-4786 instances can be seen moving towards Beta and Gamma, their arms raised in a welcoming gesture.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Beta! Gamma! Get back here, now!\n\n\n[Both SCP-4786 instances step closer and Alpha brings his firearm to his shoulder and discharges it at one of the instances. The projectile impacts against the figure's abdomen, but it illicits no reaction.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Free fire, don't hit our boys, concentrate on whatever those are.\n\n\n[The rest of the team open fire on the two instances who halt under the fusillade of oncoming projectiles. One of them turns towards the team, and the bullet impacts can be seen regenerating as quickly as they are made. It suddenly moves forward with a speed that the camera is unable to capture and Delta's scream is cut short as several thin tendrils of flesh streak forward from the instance's left hand and impale him in his throat and face.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Out. Epsilon, you first. Go.\n\n\n[The tendrils attached to Delta's face and neck bulge as if something is moving within it from Delta to the instance.]\n\n\nAlpha:\n Get away from him!\n\n\n[The Major draws his combat knife and steps up to Delta and the instance feeding on him. He quickly draws his knife through the tendrils, neatly severing them. The thing screams and recoils from them both, and Montserrat quickly lifts Delta into a fireman's carry and hastily withdraws.]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n \nAlpha, Epsilon, and Zeta were the only surviving members of the survey team. Delta never regained consciousness and succumbed to his wounds in the helicopter en route back to Pyongyang. Beta and Gamma were presumed lost and their bodies were never found in subsequent trips back to LoI-4786.\n\n\nAn autopsy performed upon Delta revealed that significant portions of the muscle tissue in his neck, larynx, facial fascia, and a minor portion of his brain had been sliced free. This was deemed to have been caused by the serrated tongue-like appendage found within the remnants of the tendrils that the SCP-4786 instance had attached to his neck and face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the significant cost involved in mounting a full-scale suppression expedition into the LoI-4786 complex, the entrance was sealed on the orders of Foundation assets within the DPRK government. A unit of Alpha-1 was also stationed at LoI-4786 disguised as members of the KPAGF.\n\n\nThe Foundation was unable to free up the assets necessary to achieve full containment of SCP-4786 until advanced inoculation techniques were developed by the Antimemetics Department in 1962. In June of that year, a successful incursion into LoI-4786 was launched that was able to subdue and retrieve all three instances of SCP-4786 with only minor casualties.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoI-4786 file photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interior of LoI-4786 was fully mapped and was revealed to be a complex made up almost entirely by the single large cavernous space containing a full-size replica of the Palace of Heavenly Purity (also known as Qianqing Palace \u4e7e\u6e05\u5bab). The original palace was once the Imperial Residence during the Ming dynasty, but was reserved for more ceremonial functions during the Qing dynasty.\n\n\nThis replica building matches the original in almost every way, with the primary difference being the tablet hung above the imperial throne. While the tablet in the original palace read \"\u6b63\u5927\u5149\u660e\" or \"let the righteous shine\", the Mandarin script on this tablet was replaced with \u00c4m\u00e4rangn\u00e4\n6\n cuneiform which reads \"n\u00e4lik\u00e4na suk\u00e4nta ilma\", which roughly translates to \"with great hunger, god ascends\".\n\n\nFurther research into SCP-4786 and the LoI-4786 complex was once again put on indefinite hold until 2014, when Dr. Jaime Forrester recognized SCP-4786 as a Sarkic artifact while investigating the history of \nSCP-3862\n. After his death in 2015, his research into SCP-4786 was continued by Dr. Samira Golzar.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCPF Internal Memorandum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM:\n Dr. Samira Golzar\n\n\nTO:\n Dr. Andreas G\u00f6tz\n\n\nDATE:\n 2015/08/19\n\n\nRE:\n SCP-4786 containment\n\n\n\nAndreas,\n\n\nI'm not sure what stroke of genius took Dr. Hong Hyun-Ki and inspired him to restrict SCP-4786's nutritional intake, but that is almost certainly what has prevented the SCP-4786 instances from attempting to escape all these years.\n\n\nThe Foundation had almost no knowledge of the Sarkic cults in those days, but his initial hypothesis that these represented some form of directed carnomancy rather than simply the product of traditional thaumaturgy seems to have been completely correct. I think that by feeding them slightly more than their required daily caloric intake was enough to prevent them from seeking additional sustenance.\n\n\nThe recent MRI scans I was able to make of their internal structures has been wildly useful. While there are still some structures present that I can only guess at, several of the previously-unknown organs are similar enough to some of the \nSK-BIO Type 006\n symbiotes that we've found in other Sarkic entities. I think that some of these organisms are what allow these entities to \"contain\" significant flesh reserves for use in their carnomantic crafting.\n\n\nAdditionally, I have been doing a significant amount of research into the \u00c4m\u00e4rangn\u00e4 linguistic database created by Dr. Low\n7\n and her department. We have been unable to effectively communicate with the SCP-4786 instances, and I believe that that is a result of our incorrect assumption that they have been speaking a previously unknown version of Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0 Mandarin. In fact, they are speaking an even older language.\n\n\nThe other thing that the MRI scans provided is insight into how old the SCP-4786 instances actually are. I believe now that these were created at some point during the Xia Dynasty, which also matches up with some of the other evidence of Sarkic influence in China after the end of the War of the Flesh at the beginning of the 16th century, BCE.\n\n\nI made the \u00c4m\u00e4rangn\u00e4 database available to Tianhe.aic, and he thinks that they are speaking a blended dialect of \u00c4m\u00e4rangn\u00e4 and Old Chinese.\n\n\nI'd like permission to interview one of the SCP-4786 instances. I think that with Tianhe.aic's help, I'll be able to actually open a dialogue with SCP-4786.\n\n\nSamira\n\n\n\n\nAfter several failed attempts at engaging the individual SCP-4786 instances in dialogue, Dr. Golzar was given permission to conduct a video-conference interview with all three instances. Each one was moved to different secure interview chambers where video conferencing equipment had been set up to allow all four participants to see and hear one another.\n\n\nDr. Golzar participated from an observation room where she could also independently monitor SCP-4786-A directly.\n\n\n\n\n\u25a0\u00a04786.doc.02\u00a0-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Transcript\u00a0\u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25a1\u00a04786.doc.02\u00a0-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Transcript\u00a0\u25a1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2015/09/13 @ 13:02\n\n\nResearcher:\n Dr. Samira Golzar\n\n\nResearch Objects:\n SCP-4786-A, -B, & -C\n\n\nForeword:\n \nThis interview was conducted in what is believed to be the SCP-4786 instances' native language with Tianhe.iac providing translation. Several minutes of initial syncing issues and syntax modifications by Tianhe.aic have been omitted for brevity.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n I think that will just about do it. Are you able to understand me?\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n Yes, Dr. Golzar.\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n We now understand-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n Your words.\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n Um, yes. Thank you. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your origin, if you don't mind.\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n Of course.\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n We do not mind-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n Answering questions.\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n Ok, who are you? What are you?\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n 'What' is easier-\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n For us-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n To answer.\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n The Lord hungered-\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n And we were made-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n So that He/They would no longer.\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n Who was your Lord?\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n n\u00e4lik\u00e4\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n ta\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n reik\u00e4\n\n\n[Dr. Golzar turns off her microphone and frowns at Tianhe.aic's monitor.]\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n Why didn't you translate that, Tianhe?\n\n\nTianhe.aic:\n I am having a little trouble with it, Samira. \nn\u00e4lik\u00e4 ta reik\u00e4\n could mean \"The hole that lusts\", or perhaps \"the opening/orifice that hungers\", I am uncertain. From the context, I would assume that it means \"The Mouth that Hungers\".\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n Also, what's with the \"He/They\" business?\n\n\nTianhe.aic:\n The word they are using is \nnisatse-\u00e4n\u00e4\n which seems to be a portmanteau of \nnisu\n - 'woman/female', \nmatse\n - \"man/male\", and \n\u00e4n\u00e4\n - \"many\".\n\n\n[After a moment of contemplation, Dr. Golzar nods at the monitor and turns her microphone back on.]\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n Ok. That makes a kind of sense. How did \"n\u00e4lik\u00e4 ta reik\u00e4\" create you?\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n No. n\u00e4lik\u00e4 ta reik\u00e4-\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n Did not make us-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n Someone else. For Him/They.\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n So you were made to sate the hunger of your Lord. Then what happened?\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n Not yet.\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n We still wait-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n To end His/Their hunger.\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n You have been waiting a long time.\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n Yes. It has been long.\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n But we will wait-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n Only a short time now.\n\n\nDr. Golzar:\n What do you mean, only a short time?\n\n\nSCP-4786-A:\n He/They stirs.\n\n\nSCP-4786-B:\n Our creator went-\n\n\nSCP-4786-C:\n To find the Others.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:\n \nAfter this exchange, the SCP-4786 instances refused to give any more information about either\n n\u00e4lik\u00e4 ta reik\u00e4 \ntheir creator, or the \"others\" spoken of. After several more abortive attempts to get the instances to give more information, Dr. Golzar terminated the interview and SCP-4786 was returned to their rooms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct I: \nEt Ecce Equus Pallidus\n | \nIn Memoria, Adytum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
