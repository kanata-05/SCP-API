Answered questions are stored in a backlog which is organized into a number of subcategories that reference various broad anomalous topics.\n\n\nMost of the discussion posts usually contain general questions about abnormal incidences rather than specific inquiries into anomalous mechanisms and minutiae. This follows from the intended audience of SCP-5312 being individuals who are otherwise unaware of paranormal behavior.\n\n\nThe nature of SCP-5312\u2019s thaumaturgic connection to the Internet is currently under investigation. The rise of non-standard modalities in which anomalous individuals may connect to the Internet is of particular concern due to the rapid innovation in this space.\n\n\nIt is possible that SCP-5312 alters the cognition of its users in some way. However, this is uncertain, as cognitohazard tests done by Research Team 5312/4 have led to no detectable memetic capacity.\n\n\nSCP-5312 is managed by an unknown individual or group which is thought to be associated with the Serpent\u2019s Hand due to the prevalence of serpentine and arboreal iconography on the website.\n\n\nMany of the answers written by SCP-5312 contain language that aligns with the ethos and thematic elements that are prevalent within Serpent\u2019s Hand ideology and literature. The answers, therefore, include a general anti-containment sentiment are written with a sanctimonious tone. The webpage, however, never makes direct allusions to the GOI itself.\n\n\nWhen navigating to SCP-5312, an individual is first presented with a text which reads as follows.\n\n\n\n\nYou are the most powerful thing to have ever existed.\n\n\nYet, there are those who hide your ability from you.\n\n\nThink, have you ever seen something you could never explain?\n\n\nEver feel like something about life just doesn\u2019t feel right?\n\n\nWere you ever curious enough to peer behind the curtain?\n\n\nSome of you who have searched for us have recognized the pure world, yet not dare engage with it. Some of you have awakened to mankind\u2019s potential, yet barely understand what you are.\n\n\nBut no matter your circumstances, we are all people who seek knowledge.\n\n\nBecause with knowledge comes power and with power comes freedom.\n\n\nAnd there will soon be a day when we will all be free.\n\n\n~\nA Hopeful Idealist\n\n\n\n\nBelow this, an individual may enter in a question and review the previously answered questions from other people. The following interactions are a series of noteworthy entries in SCP-5312 For a complete list, please contact Research Team 5312/4.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\u00a01:\u00a0\"qqq\u00a0Weird\u00a0stuff\u00a0happens\u00a0when\u00a0I\u00a0kiss?\"\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\u00a01:\u00a0\"qqq\u00a0Weird\u00a0stuff\u00a0happens\u00a0when\u00a0I\u00a0kiss?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent from an Anonymous User\n:\n\n\nHi, Ive had this problem for a while now and I'm going to be leaving my fosterhome soon to dorm at college so Im really hoping for a longterm fix for my problem.\n\nSince my birth, whenever I kiss something they forget an entire day (at max 24 hours).\n\n\n\nI\u2019m actually not joking lol, its happened to mom dozens of times. When she kisses me on the cheek, its like she forgets the entire last day.\n\n\nAnd its caused a lot of problems with my gf becuz she is the only one ive told and when we tried to test it out, she forgot.\n\n\n\nI never really told my parents and my gf told me to go to the hospital but im dont want them to test me or anything cuz they i dont want any weird tests on me.\n\n\nAfter some reflection I think that its a type of paranormal effect like perhaps Im possessed?\n\n\nWhat can i do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nTopic\n: Ascended Human\n\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou have been born with a rare gift, one that transcends our primitive concepts of logic and sense.\n\n\n\nThough we do not know how or why your body contains such a constitution we do have some theories. Oftentimes, interactions with the paranormal or anomalous by one of our birth parents causes an intergenerational effect.\n\n\n\nOr perhaps, since your ability seems to be involved with memory manipulation, you may have been blessed by any plethora of trickster gods/goddesses.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, we urge you to continue to be careful for your skill is useful and many within the world will try to trap you or use you like a tool.\n\n\n\nThus, one effective way to temporarily halt basic memory manipulation is to mix lotus root, goldenseal root, and turmeric powder and rub it on the affected area every night (the lips in your case).\n\n\n\nPermanent, de-coupling solutions may be found in various Free Ports.\n\n\n\nBut we do not recommend this fix for those not already involved in the anomalous world.\n\n\n\n~\nAn Intermediate Thaumaturgist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\u00a05:\u00a0\"please\u00a0help\"\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\u00a05:\u00a0\"please\u00a0help\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSent from an Anonymous User\n:\n\n\nI am 64 years old .I am diagnosed with a terminal illness, polycarcinoma of the liver, ..I have tried various types of shamanisitic magic (mexican) before but it has not worked..ill try anything so what can I do to get rid of this thing or live longer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\nTopic\n: Anomalous Physiological Change\n\n\n\nThere are many ways in which an individual may extend his life.
