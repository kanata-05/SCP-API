This is an SCP that is only describable using interactive media. I utilized RPG Maker to create this, and there are 4 endings.\n\n\nSpoilers on the discussion page.\n\n\nI got lots of help and testing on this. Pretty sure I dinged all the testers in the credits, but special thanks to Decibelles, TwistedGears, and Waterfire. Additionally thank you to SunnyClockwork for the beautiful artwork I used in the game.\n\n\nNote: My original SCP-245 was moved to the SCP-2623 slot with specific explicit permission from the administration given the nature of the project I put into the SCP-245 slot. It should not be taken as a precedent of any kind as to permission to do any such action in the future.\n\n\nAlso! If you play this and spot a bug, mention it here. I'll fix it as soon as possible. I've run through this myself a hundred times or more, but I'm sure I or my testers missed something.\n\n\nAnd I've requested that the page be locked so no one can edit it and mess with the links. If you're wondering why it's locked.\n\n\nEdit: Until I was halfway through making it, I was unaware that this wouldn't run on Macs (or even that Macs can't run EXEs). Despite that, I have been told by other users that a windows emulator can run this program no problem. Suggested emulators such as \"Wine\" and \"Bootcamp\" have been mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b8 More by this Author \u25c2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{$comments2}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{$doesthisfixthebug}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrating:\u00a0\n+777\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-245\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Copies of SCP-245-1 are to be contained on airgapped computers.
