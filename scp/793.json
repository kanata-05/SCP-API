When testing, access is to be restricted to Class-Ds. No other Foundation personnel are to be allowed entrance. The future installation of security cameras around the hospital is a possibility.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-793 is described as a hyper-reproductive paranormal variation of Human Congo trypanosomiasis (a parasitic protozoa also known as the \"African Sleeping Sickness\") inhabiting the abandoned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Medicinal Center located in [DATA EXPUNGED], built by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 missionaries in 18\u2588\u2588. SCP-793's first known appearance was documented in 19\u2588\u2588. The hospital was subsequently relinquished from use \u2588 years after due to exponential growth of SCP-793, but it was never demolished due to superstitions the populous and prominent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 tribes held. In 19\u2588\u2588, the hospital was secured by the Foundation. SCP-793, in its passive form, does not appear to exist unless a suitable human host enters the Zone of Denial (ZoD), which is currently estimated to be 13.4 meters from any point around the hospital.\n\n\nWhen a human enters the zone of denial, the organism will appear spontaneously inside the human's circulatory system. Unlike a normal form of trypanosomiasis, which has a limited rate of reproduction, the reproductive rate of SCP-793 increases proportionally to the subject's distance into the ZoD, e.g. when a subject is at the edge of the ZoD, SCP-793 will reproduce at ~5% the speed of Human Congo trypanosomiasis, but once inside the hospital (where reproductive capability is at a constant), SCP-793 cells will reproduce at ~400% the speed of their cousin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Medicinal Center, the current residence of SCP-793\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms appear to be dissimilar to those of normal Congo trypanosomiasis, with a notable increase in hysteria and swelling of the lymph nodes. The opposite occurs when a subject leaves the ZoD. The reproductive rate decreases, and parasites will spontaneously disappear, with no visible signs of cell death. Somatic cells whose deaths can be attributed to SCP-793 will appear as if origination suddenly occurs, not as of the result of general somatic mitosis. The symptoms will fade to those of earlier stages (from the neurological phase going to the haemolymphatic stage, etc) until the are no signs of the protist existing when a human victim exits the ZoD.\n\n\nOne final note about possible human death as the result of SCP-793's actions: the \"reversal effects\" reverse victim death completely. Once the deceased are rescued from the maximum reproductive zone, somatic cells appear immediately and any remaining instances of SCP-793 disappear. Upon the so-called \"undeath\", individuals often recall extreme pain due to the reconstruction of their body (mostly regarded as something along the lines of \"thousands of knives piercing [their] body\") and have no recollection of ever entering the Zone of Denial or any knowledge of SCP-793.\n\n\nSCP-793's reversal effects only regard any damage it causes a human. Bodies whose deaths are attributed to other causes (such as normal Human Congo trypanosomiasis) will not be affected. SCP-793 \ndoes not seem to appear on anything that is not a living human body entering the Zone of Denial\n does not appear on anything that is not living human tissue. Appearance of SCP-793 does occur on partial entrance of a human to the Zone of Denial and is limited to the fraction of the human that is in the Zone of Denial.\n\n\nItems brought out of the Hospital have no unique effect attached to them.\n\n\nAddendum SCP-793:XOJ1:\n \nREGARDING SITE DEMOLITION OF SCP-793 VIA \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nAs suggested by Dr. William Hunt and Chong Meng, Ph.
