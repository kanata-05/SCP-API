The entrance to SCP-3194 is enclosed in a 50\u00a0m opaque geodesic dome. Due to the geographical remoteness of SCP-3194, no additional containment procedures are deemed necessary at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3194 is an underground structure of unusual size located beneath the Antarctic Plateau. It consists of two sub-structures, designated SCP-3194-1 and SCP-3194-2.\n\n\nSCP-3194-1 is a 2.4\u00a0m \u00d7 3.6\u00a0m \u00d7 280.45\u00a0km tunnel that intersects the surface of the plateau at 87\u00b0\u2588\u2588\u2032\u2588\u2588\u2033 S., \u2212126\u00b0\u2588\u2588\u2032\u2588\u2588\u2033 W. It descends at an angle of 2.55\u00b0 (measured 5\u00a0m from the opening) to a depth of approximately 6.3\u00a0km beneath the surface. At its terminus, SCP-3194-1 opens into an immense chamber designated SCP-3194-2. Estimates based on dead reckoning place SCP-3194-2 within ten kilometers of the geographic south pole.\n\n\nBoth SCP-3194-1 and SCP-3194-2 are constructed out of cubic blocks of basalt measuring 1.2\u00a0m and weighing approximately 5.2 tonnes each. The origin of these blocks is unknown. Radiometric dating has thus far been unsuccessful due to abnormally low concentrations of potassium, rubidium and uranium isotopes in the stone. The best-confidence upper limit for the age of the blocks is 9.9\u00a0Gy, which is somewhat in excess of twice the currently estimated age of the Earth.\n\n\nSCP-3194-3 is the designation for the phenomenon located at the approximate center of SCP-3194-2. SCP-3194-3 appears to be an ovoid-toroidal volume of circulating hot gas 21\u00a0m in diameter at its widest point and 27\u00a0m long, oriented with its axis of symmetry parallel to SCP-3194-1. The lowest point of SCP-3194-3 is approximately 5\u00a0m above the floor of SCP-3194-2. SCP-3194-3 emits light in a spectrum close to that of a blackbody with a temperature of 5900K. However, the luminance of SCP-3194-3 is inconsistent with its apparent composition and temperature, and it appears to radiate no heat into its environment. No abnormal radiation or magnetic fields have been detected in proximity to SCP-3194-3.\n\n\nDocument 3194.1:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-3194 was initially discovered on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 during a routine review of Earth-observation imaging. The feature was initially believed to be a moulin\n1\n of unknown origin in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Foundation satellite KNOTHOLE-33 was tasked to obtain high-resolution imagery of the feature. It was at this time that the geometric properties of the feature were identified. A Foundation research team was redirected from [DATA EXPUNGED] confirmed the apparently anomalous nature of the structure. In \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Area 837B was constructed to contain SCP-3194 and to facilitate exploration of the structure.\n\n\nDocument 3194.2:\n Exploration Reports\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Report\u00a03194-01\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Report\u00a03194-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nReport Filed By:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Lead researcher, SCP-3194\n\n\nMission Brief:\n Attempts at using laser rangefinding to determine the extent of SCP-3194 have failed. It is unknown if this is the result of atmospheric conditions inside SCP-3194 or another cause. A standard Mark VI-B1 remotely operated exploration robot (\u201cWALDO-6 unit\u201d) equipped with visible-light and infrared imaging will be deployed into SCP-3194 to determine its extent.\n\n\nResult:\n WALDO-6 unit made it 10.11\u00a0km before exhausting its battery power and shutting down. No new features documented. WALDO-6 unit remains inside SCP-3194. This structure is obviously much larger than suspected. Recommend calling in MTF Zeta-9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest for MTF deployment approved. \u2014\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Area 837B Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Report\u00a03194-02\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Report\u00a03194-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nReport Filed By:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Lead researcher, SCP-3194\n\n\nMission Brief:\n MTF Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d) will be equipped with two days\u2019 supplies plus reserve margin and sent into SCP-3194 with orders to proceed until they find something worth reporting or have to turn back.\n\n\nResult:\n MTF Zeta-9 forced to turn back after 11 hours (49.8\u00a0km) due to mission-jeopardizing claustrophobia symptoms on part of all team members. Recommend psychological screening or other precaution in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZeta-9 members\n are \nscreened for claustrophobic tendencies, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Claustrophobia is practically the job description. \u2014 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Mobile Task Force Command\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Report\u00a03194-03\n\n\n\n\nExploration\u00a0Report\u00a03194-03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nReport Filed By:\n Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Lead researcher, SCP-3194\n\n\nMission Brief:\n MTF Zeta-9 (\u201cMole Rats\u201d) will be equipped with two days\u2019 supplies plus reserve margin and sent into SCP-3194 with orders to proceed until they find something worth reporting or have to turn back. Anxiolytic regimen to include \u2588\u2588\u2588 mg \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588 times daily.\n\n\nResult:\n MTF Zeta-9 reached the 50\u00a0km mark. No interior features identified. Inclinometer at 50\u00a0km indicated a slope of 2.10\u00b0, consistent with hypothesis that SCP-3194 runs perpendicular to earth\u2019s axis. Reflector-aided laser surveying confirms SCP-3194 is as close to perfectly straight as we can measure.\n\n\nEstimates of the geometry of SCP-3194 suggest that, if it just keeps going, it should be at most 567\u00a0km long. The size of the tunnel and lack of air circulation makes gas-powered vehicles impractical, and we don\u2019t have anything electric with nearly enough range. All things being equal, it should take MTF Zeta-9 approximately 105 hours to cover this distance on foot. Factoring in rest periods and a safety margin, that\u2019s a maximum of ten days there, ten days back. In the dark. Alone.

Millimeter-wave radar scan of SCP-3194-2 and spectrography studies of SCP-3194-3 returned, along with 11 hours 9 minutes of video of SCP-3194-2 and SCP-3194-3.\n\n\nZeta-9-11 recovered fully from what was apparently an absence seizure of unusual severity. No further symptoms were observed during mission.\n\n\nResults of radar scan show SCP-3194-2 is a hemicylindrical chamber approximately two kilometers in width, one kilometer high at center line, and six kilometers long. No columns, buttresses or other load-bearing features are apparent. How the roof of SCP-3194-2 supports its own weight is unknown.\n\n\nResults of spectrography studies of SCP-3194-3 indicate the presence of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and potassium in a mixture of atomic and ionized states. Proportions of elements is consistent to within 0.3% with the elemental composition of DNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument 3194.3:\n Incident Reports\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a0Report\u00a03194-01\n\n\n\n\nIncident\u00a0Report\u00a03194-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nReport Filed By:\n \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Security division head, Area 837B\n\n\nDescription of Incident:\n At 0330 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 (all times local), MTF Zeta-9-11 breached containment of SCP-3194 and entered SCP-3194-1. Containment breach went undetected until Zeta-9-11\u2019s absence was noted at breakfast. Review of recorded video surveillance showed Zeta-9-11 entering SCP-3194 carrying standard-issue rucksack. Contents of rucksack provisionally assumed to be food and water. If correct, total volume of food and water not sufficient for journey to SCP-3194-2.\n\n\nAt 0850 rest of MTF Zeta-9 entered SCP-3194-1 with orders to intercept Zeta-9-11 and return to base.\n\n\nAt 1645 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, MTF Zeta-9 intercepted Zeta-9-11\u00a0144\u00a0km inside SCP-3194-1. Zeta-9-11 was found kneeling in total darkness with hands clasped, rocking back and forth and speaking unintelligibly in a barely audible voice. Upon examination by Zeta-9-6, Zeta-9-11 appeared to be suffering from severe dehydration and an altered mental state. Attempts to rouse Zeta-9-11 were unsuccessful; attempts to physically manipulate Zeta-9-11 into a supine position were resisted. With assistance, Zeta-9-6 was able to begin administration of intravenous fluids. Upon consultation via radio with Site 837B medical personnel, it was decided that Zeta-9-6 should sedate Zeta-9-11 via intravenous midazolam.

The feature was initially believed to be a moulin 1 of unknown origin in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Foundation satellite KNOTHOLE-33 was tasked to obtain high-resolution imagery of the feature. It was at this time that the geometric properties of the feature were identified. A Foundation research team was redirected from [DATA EXPUNGED] confirmed the apparently anomalous nature of the structure. In \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Area 837B was constructed to contain SCP-3194 and to facilitate exploration of the structure.",

It is unknown if this is the result of atmospheric conditions inside SCP-3194 or another cause. A standard Mark VI-B1 remotely operated exploration robot (\u201cWALDO-6 unit\u201d) equipped with visible-light and infrared imaging will be deployed into SCP-3194 to determine its extent. Result: WALDO-6 unit made it 10.11\u00a0km before exhausting its battery power and shutting down. No new features documented. WALDO-6 unit remains inside SCP-3194. This structure is obviously much larger than suspected. Recommend calling in MTF Zeta-9.",

Result: MTF Zeta-9 reached the 50\u00a0km mark. No interior features identified. Inclinometer at 50\u00a0km indicated a slope of 2.10\u00b0, consistent with hypothesis that SCP-3194 runs perpendicular to earth\u2019s axis. Reflector-aided laser surveying confirms SCP-3194 is as close to perfectly straight as we can measure. Estimates of the geometry of SCP-3194 suggest that, if it just keeps going, it should be at most 567\u00a0km long. The size of the tunnel and lack of air circulation makes gas-powered vehicles impractical, and we don\u2019t have anything electric with nearly enough range. All things being equal, it should take MTF Zeta-9 approximately 105 hours to cover this distance on foot. Factoring in rest periods and a safety margin, that\u2019s a maximum of ten days there, ten days back. In the dark. Alone. Better them than me.",

The flare\u2019s burned out now so we\u2019re back in the dark. It\u2019s better. Not great, but better. I think we\u2019re okay now. Base: Copy that. Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wants vitals on all of you: rate, BP. Are you able to comply? \u03b6-9-24: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? \u03b6-9-6: [Spitting sound.] Aye aye. [12 minutes of log omitted.] Base: Okay, copy all that. Looks nominal.

Base: We hope so too. Any other physical symptoms so far? \u03b6-9-24: Don\u2019t think so, base. I think it was just the vertigo, and that\u2019s passed. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? \u03b6-9-6: A-OK. \u03b6-9-24: \u2588\u2588\u2588? \u03b6-9-15: Yeah, okay. \u03b6-9-24: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?

        "Result: MTF Zeta-9 exited SCP-3194 after 191 hours 48 minutes. Millimeter-wave radar scan of SCP-3194-2 and spectrography studies of SCP-3194-3 returned, along with 11 hours 9 minutes of video of SCP-3194-2 and SCP-3194-3. Zeta-9-11 recovered fully from what was apparently an absence seizure of unusual severity. No further symptoms were observed during mission. Results of radar scan show SCP-3194-2 is a hemicylindrical chamber approximately two kilometers in width, one kilometer high at center line, and six kilometers long. No columns, buttresses or other load-bearing features are apparent. How the roof of SCP-3194-2 supports its own weight is unknown. Results of spectrography studies of SCP-3194-3 indicate the presence of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and potassium in a mixture of atomic and ionized states. Proportions of elements is consistent to within 0.3% with the elemental composition of DNA.",

Containment breach went undetected until Zeta-9-11\u2019s absence was noted at breakfast. Review of recorded video surveillance showed Zeta-9-11 entering SCP-3194 carrying standard-issue rucksack. Contents of rucksack provisionally assumed to be food and water. If correct, total volume of food and water not sufficient for journey to SCP-3194-2. At 0850 rest of MTF Zeta-9 entered SCP-3194-1 with orders to intercept Zeta-9-11 and return to base. At 1645 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, MTF Zeta-9 intercepted Zeta-9-11\u00a0144\u00a0km inside SCP-3194-1. Zeta-9-11 was found kneeling in total darkness with hands clasped, rocking back and forth and speaking unintelligibly in a barely audible voice. Upon examination by Zeta-9-6, Zeta-9-11 appeared to be suffering from severe dehydration and an altered mental state. Attempts to rouse Zeta-9-11 were unsuccessful; attempts to physically manipulate Zeta-9-11 into a supine position were resisted. With assistance, Zeta-9-6 was able to begin administration of intravenous fluids. Upon consultation via radio with Site 837B medical personnel, it was decided that Zeta-9-6 should sedate Zeta-9-11 via intravenous midazolam. A dose of 2\u20132.5\u00a0mg of intravenous midazolam is typically sufficient to induce sedation. Zeta-9-11 did not respond to two injections of 2\u00a0mg each, and required 8\u00a0mg of midazolam before she was adequately sedated.
