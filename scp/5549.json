The primary vector of containment is a 1,398 meter borehole drilled directly into the Earth, at the bottom of which is a square 5m cell containing SCP-5549. Motion sensors are set to alert Site-05 if any abnormal activity is detected from the cell.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5549, formerly D-293 & Doctor Jacques Boucher, is a hostile sapient entity with Class V ontokinetic abilities. Additionally, SCP-5549 is highly resistant to all forms of damage tested against it. The extent of SCP-5549's abilities is currently unknown.\n\n\nSCP-5549 was created by the Foundation Department of Inter-Anomaly Experimentation as part of Project LONDON BRIDGE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 5549.1\n\n\nProject Proposal LONDON BRIDGE Committee Hearing, November 30th, 1975\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n\nSHARP:\n Good evening, Liaison Je-\n\n\nO5-11:\n I'm not Doc Jefferson, son.\n\n\nSHARP:\n Pardon?

Oh.\n\n\nO5-11:\n Five-eleven, yes. Surprised?\n\n\nSHARP:\n I\u2026 wasn't aware you were going to be handling my case.\n\n\nO5-11:\n I'm not. Normally your proposal would've sat at the bottom of some yellow-bellied paper-pushing secretary's desk for six months and then rejected because he had a bad day.

The Atreus Array, the SRAs, we even managed to exploit the fucking eel. Nowadays you have to fill out seventeen forms and take a piss test to borrow a pen.

You and your project.\n\n\nSHARP:\n How?\n\n\nO5-11:\n You seem to have a good head on your shoulders. Did you know that they were considering dissolving the department before your proposal?\n\n\nSHARP:\n \"They\"?\n\n\nO5-11:\n The other members of the council.

Protecting the world is bloody work. And we need your help.\n\n\nD-293:\n What could you possibly want from me?\n\n\nSHARP:\n We need people. We need individuals willing to work with us to protect the rest of the world from those threats. We need people with nothing left to lose.\n\n\nD-293:\n I-I don't have any special skills or anything. I'm a college dropout. I don't know how I can help you.\n\n\nSHARP:\n Everyone can help in their own ways.\n\n\nD-293:\n What's mine?\n\n\nSHARP:\n Testing. It's ugly work, but someone has to do it.

On that note, I'd like to make an addition to the testing schedule: Semi-regular psychological check-ups. I can't imagine this kind of testing to be good for one's mental health, and keeping the subject complacent is rather important in this venture.

Actually, that's in regards to all her bones; she might be suffering from calcium deficiency. Regardless, she's not dead, so that's already a big plus. I'm going to recommend a higher calorie diet to make up for that weight loss. Since we haven't exposed her to any ontokinetics yet, I don't think Hume Rating will be a problem.

If an organism sleeps in one of the coffins, within 24 hours, a clone of the organism will manifest in the cave.\n \u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\nSubject was placed into coffin, test proceeded without incident. Clone, temporarily designated D-293-b, was recovered from caves.\n\n\nNotably, D-293-b was identical to D-293 prior to testing, suggesting that their DNA has not been altered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-610\nSCP-610 is a contagious skin disease that results in the death of the infected, followed by a return of life functions. Scar tissue formed during infection will begin to mutate and move toward other vectors of infection.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\nSubject and D-293 were placed in a testing chamber, and D-293-b was exposed to a sample of SCP-610. The temperature of the chamber was increased and within seven minutes, D-293-b had been completely covered. Subject panicked and attempted to exit testing chamber, slamming against the door several times. When deterrent electrical shocks were applied, it attempted to break through the observation glass. Despite this, they were quickly absorbed into the rapidly-increasing mass of SCP-610. Testing was stopped and SCP-427 was applied.\n\n\nThe mass quickly shrank in size, disappearing entirely within four minutes. Subject was recovered from the center of the mass, unconscious. D-293-b was not recovered. Subject was noted to have significantly altered body proportions, growing by several centimeters and having more clearly visible blood vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-682\nSCP-682 is a reptilian creature with massive regeneration and adaptive capabilities. It has been observed moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed or rotted.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\n10g of flesh were cut from SCP-682 using SCP-2207. This flesh was dried and placed into cold storage, effectively freezing it. Subject was forcibly sedated and prepared for surgery. Incision was made in lower left forearm and sample was placed within after being slightly heated. Incision was sealed and subject placed into recovery.\n\n\nSample began immediate growth and spread through subject's body, causing significant distress to subject. Sample had spread to upper calf when Dr. Boucher, the operating surgeon, amputated D-293's left leg at the knee. After decontamination, the leg was observed slowly regrowing. Growth did not halt after the limb had reformed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM 5549.12\n\n\nD-293 Medical Report, January 12th 1976\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT LONDON BRIDGE\n\n\nDr. Jacques Boucher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n\n\n238cm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n50.9kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocalized Hume Rating\n\n\n70/123\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis testing cycle has been our most intensive yet and it's resulted in some unforeseen changes.

I'm growing apprehensive about their anomalous capabilities as well \u2014 the Localized Hume Rating can't just be a result of the other anomalies anymore, and I've put in a recommendation to turn up the SRAs in the cell.

But it's necessary.\n\n\nBOUCHER:\n How on Earth is any of this necessary? What do you hope to learn? And don't give me the generic 'advancing our understanding' crap, you know I'm beyond that.\n\n\nSHARP:\n This is what the Foundation has always been about.

We have to deal with the Insurgency, the Gocks, and two dozen world governments. We have the world's biggest treasure trove of anomalies and we don't have the balls to use them to our advantage.\n\n\nBOUCHER:\n Our job isn't to use them, it's to lock them up! You're trying to weaponize things we barely understand!\n\n\nSHARP:\n If one D-class has to suffer for us to understand these things, I'm willing to take that deal.

It's not only of no benefit - it actively poses a danger to all those involved. Throwing anomalies at each other to see what happens was a hallmark of a darker age for this organization, Mr. Sharp.

We could easily enforce order on the world, end these petty conflicts!\n\n\n[REDACTED]:\n This organization is committed to making the world a safer place \u2014 but never like that.

Doctor Sharp.\n\n\nSHARP:\n Present.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Your reckless behaviour endangered and killed Foundation employees. As of speaking, the product of your project is in an underground vault with an innocent researcher. This fruitless venture was of no value, took tremendous resources, and was only made possible by the meddling of your co-conspirator \u2014 Overseer Eleven.\n\n\nO5-11:\n In the flesh.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Your manipulation outside of your sphere of interest led to the deaths of multiple Foundation employees and depletion of significant resources. Your attempts to devolve this organization to a more primitive form have no place in today's Foundation. The Committee is prepared to render judgement. Effective immediately, Overseer Eleven placed on administrative leave without pay-\n\n\nO5-11:\n You motherfucker.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n - while the continued terms of his employment are subject to an internal vote of the Overseer Council.

You might not want to admit it, but this has proved me right.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n Excuse me?\n\n\nO5-11:\n We just used militarized troops and weapons to contain an anomaly. We're not burying our heads in the sand and shying away from it anymore. And that's all I ever wanted. The infrastructure is there now; it's only a matter of time before you decide to use it.\n\n\nTEJANI:\n I advise you watch your words. You don't have Overseer protections anymore.
