Negotiations with the local city government for its demolition are underway.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3352 is an anomalous event that occurred on July 2nd, 1992 at the Hardwick Petroleum Refinery (located in the city of Hardwick, Pennsylvania). This event happened in the 476HF alkylation unit \u2014 a unit that converts isobutane and other light alkenes (primarily propylene and butylene) into alkylate (a component of high-octane gasolines).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.2:\n I-beam inscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3352 is associated with a single rigid steel I-beam located in 476HF. This beam supports a pipeline attached to 476HF's reactors via an MOV (motor-operated valve). The line was part of 476HF's emergency shutdown system, providing a means to swiftly shunt hydrofluoric acid (used for alkylation) into a deinventory vessel 2.5km away. An inscription on the I-beam's upper half reads:\n\n\n\n\nGOD BLESS U.S. BETHLEHEM \"I\" BEAM STEEL.\n\n\nMSW\n\n\n\n\nIt is otherwise unremarkable.\n\n\nAddendum 3352.1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.3:\n Hydrogen heat-exchanger array (circa 1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approx. 2:00 am on July 2nd, 1992, a fire ignited off the elbow-flange of a heat-exchanger located in 386 (a catalytic reformer unit). The on-duty operator reported this to the shift-supervisor, but \u2014 after several failed attempts to snuff the fire with steam \u2014 was told to take no further action.\n\n\nAt 3:45 am, the flange experienced a catastrophic failure. Burning high-pressure hydrogen melted several adjacent exchangers, producing a chain reaction. The resulting detonation killed the operator on the unit and ejected burning debris as far as 5km.\n\n\nDuring a 1993 inquiry, William Parridge (386's lead operator) described the event:\n\n\n\n\nI was in a truck delivering samples to the lab when it happened. One moment it's night\u2026 and then? Outta no where, it's day again. Next came the boom. Jesus Christ, what a sound. Like somebody just dropped a skyscraper right behind me.\n\n\nI knew right then it was the exchangers \u2014 I'd told them to fix those things again and again. I should have shut them down. I should have shut the whole unit down the first time they started lighting off.\n\n\nBy the time I got to the fire\u2026 that's when the second explosion hit.\n\n\n\n\n4 operators from an adjacent unit and the shift supervisor (Bryan Burton) attempted to use the refinery's internal fire-water system to fight the massive blaze. The lone surviving operator (Daniel Ruhl) gave the following testimony:\n\n\n\n\nI tell him. I fucking tell him. There's ice on the fucking fire hydrants, you stupid fuck! I scream it in his face. But the fucking\u2026 he won't listen. He just keeps saying we need water, need to cool the pipes down, need to keep the fire under control.\n\n\nAnd I keep screaming \u2014 there's ice! On! The! Fucking! Hydrants!\n\n\nHe looks up at me, this short little fuck who probably got this job from Daddy, who don't know the first thing about crude, who probably ain't ever heard the word 'No' in his entire life\u2026 he looks up at me, and now there's this look in his eyes. He says, real soft\u2026 Either open that line up or get out of my way.\n\n\nAnd then, I look at those kids holding that hose \u2014 I look right back at him, right in his eyes \u2014 I fold my arms over my chest, plant myself down like a tree, and I tell him: No.\n\n\nThat fucker \ncold-cocks me!\n Just straight-up breaks three of my teeth with a steel spanner. I swear to God, it looked brand new, too \u2014 probably the first time the little shit's used it. I drop like a sack of bricks and he just starts hollering, spitting, screaming \u2014 kicking me. I curl up into a ball and roll away. Next thing I know, he's at the hydrant, he's opening that line, and \u2014 and then \u2014 fuck.\n\n\nHe was a little shit, but those kids didn't deserve that. Nobody deserves that.\n\n\n\n\nUnbeknownst to refinery personnel, the internal fire-water system had been compromised a week prior. A shift supervisor defied procedure by using a fire-hydrant to flush what he believed to be an out-of-service vessel. This vessel was, in fact, still in service \u2014 and had been backing high-pressure liquid propane into the fire-water system for eight days.\n\n\nLiquid propane depressurized through the hose, rapidly dropping its temperature and freezing both the supervisor and 3 of the operators to it. Despite ripping portions of their arms free, all four perished when the propane cloud ignited.\n\n\nImmediately after this second explosion, operators initiated emergency shut-downs on all units. This included the activation of 476HF's emergency shutdown system. In 1993, Jefferson Reeds, one of the refinery's engineers, explained how the system worked:\n\n\n\n\nAsk a chemist to compile a list of their top-ten 'Worst Chemicals to Work With', and hydrofluoric acid\u2026 it might not make number 1, but it's making the list. Sulfuric acid is safer, but you need a lot more of it for alkylation. So\u2026 HF is the way to go if you want to save a buck.\n\n\nBut I cannot over-emphasize: This is horrible, horrible stuff.\n\n\nFor starters, it burns through just about anything. That includes glass. When you get some on you, it doesn't just burn your skin. It screws with your nervous system and slips into your bloodstream. There, it can disrupt your body's ability to metabolize calcium \u2014 giving you a heart-attack. It boils at room temperature and, quite literally, eats your bones.\n\n\nIn short? Get splashed with a quart of this stuff and there's a pretty fair chance you'll be dead in 24 hours.\n\n\nThe low boiling point is what makes it a real problem, though. You think a vat of bone-eating acid is bad? Now imagine it's a burning cloud of bone-eating acid. Imagine that cloud is rolling through the town we're built on top of. If the wind's blowing the right way\u2026? An HF cloud can kill thousands. \nTens\n of thousands. It could take out the whole city of Hardwick.\n\n\nThat's why we installed the emergency shutdown system. A fire breaks out, you slam this button, and two dozen fire-monitors douse the unit with several million gallons of water. While the HF is getting cooled down to a liquid-state, it's also getting shunted to a deinventory tank way off-site. When Michelle hit that button, she was making the right call. It's the call I would have made, too.\n\n\nHow could she\u2026 how the hell could \nany\n of us have known the fire-water system was loaded with frigging propane?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.4:\n Last frame of security footage from 476HF's pipe alley prior to signal loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 4:07 AM, Michelle Dunwick \u2014 476HF's lead operator \u2014 activated the emergency shutdown system. All 18 fire-monitors opened to the fire-water system, ejecting high-pressure liquid propane directly into 476HF's pipe alley. Once the propane cloud ignited, the MOV for the deinventory system melted shut \u2014 trapping over half a million gallons of rapidly-expanding hydrofluoric acid inside an alkylation unit that was now on fire.\n\n\nTanya Sullivan, part of the refinery's ERT (emergency-response team), described the situation:\n\n\n\n\nWe'd just realized the refinery's whole fire-water system was full of propane \u2014 we were switching over to city-water to try and fight the blaze \u2014 when 476 lit up. Then we were told the MOV failed. 476 was burning \nand\n full of boiling acid. If that acid kept getting hotter\u2026 the whole unit would blow.\n\n\nThat's when we knew this place was done for. No way we'd still be running \u2014 not after this. But at that point\u2026 it wasn't about saving our jobs. Not anymore. At that point\u2026\n\n\nLook, you know the risk when you work in a shithole like this. If fire don't get you, the cancer from all the toxins will. But if 476 blew\u2026 it wouldn't just take \nus\n. It'd take everything in a 3-mile radius.\n\n\nWhen you build a refinery, you're putting everyone around it in the line of fire. That means something. Something is \nowed\n. The stakeholders, the owners, the supervisors \u2014 none of them feel the weight of that debt. But someone has to. Someone has to lift that load.\n\n\nThat's why we all grabbed our shit and ran down to 476 as fast as our legs could carry us. Not to save our jobs, not to save the refinery, not even to save our own skin. We did it because this shithole might have been done for, but we'd be damned if we let it take anyone else with it.\n\n\n\n\nAs the ERT fought to cool down the flames, Matthew Watkins (a 476HF operator) ran down 476HF's burning pipe alley to manually operate the MOV's bypass and evacuate the boiling acid:\n\n\n\n\nThe valve was so hot that it melted through my gloves the instant I touched it. When I opened it, I could hear the acid hissing and crackling as it rushed through the deinventory line. But by the time I was peeling what was left of my wet, sticky palms off that hot metal\u2026 it was clear that it didn't matter anyway.\n\n\nYou ever see concrete boil? It doesn't, not really. But if you hit it with enough heat \u2014 hard enough, fast enough \u2014 it turns brown, then gets soft\u2026 and all the pockets of water in it, all the other chemicals, they start boiling and bursting free. Like big, wet pools of bubbling tar \u2014 belching out toxic fumes.\n\n\nThe whole pipe alley was like that. The ground, the pillars \u2014 and the deinventory line's support struts. The fire-monitors were torching everything, and those torches were pointed right at all six struts. It was so hot that they had \nblasted the concrete off the steel beams\n.\n\n\nFive of the six beams were already slag. The line was sagging, just waiting for that last beam to give. Once it did, the deinventory line would snap \u2014 and dump half a million gallons of boiling, acidic poison right atop the pipe alley and into the heart of this city.\n\n\nI just stood there, surrounded by roaring flame, waiting for it to give. Waiting to die. Just trying to make peace with it \u2014 that we'd done all we could, and it still wasn't enough to stop us from killing everyone. So I kept waiting. And waiting. And waiting. And\u2026\n\n\n\u2026I swear to God, it was ready to give. It was getting the worst of it. It was supposed to give. It \nhad\n to give. By the end, it was glowing so bright I couldn't even look at it anymore. But\u2026\n\n\nFor three minutes, the last thing \u2014 the \nonly\n thing \u2014 standing between ten thousand souls and all the fires of hell was that thin solitary beam of Bethlehem steel.\n\n\nAnd the beam did not give. Not one goddamn inch.\n\n\n\n\nAll five hundred thousand gallons of hydrofluoric acid were safely shunted to the deinventory vessel located off-site. Once the fires were extinguished, the refinery was closed and the disaster investigated.\n\n\nFoundation researchers determined that although 476HF's I-beam had been exposed for several minutes to temperatures in excess of 2000\u00a0\u00b0C (well above steel's melting point), it had sustained no structural damage whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3351\n | SCP-3352 | \nSCP-3353\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3352\n\" by The Great Hippo, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

That's why we all grabbed our shit and ran down to 476 as fast as our legs could carry us. Not to save our jobs, not to save the refinery, not even to save our own skin. We did it because this shithole might have been done for, but we'd be damned if we let it take anyone else with it.",
        "The valve was so hot that it melted through my gloves the instant I touched it. When I opened it, I could hear the acid hissing and crackling as it rushed through the deinventory line. But by the time I was peeling what was left of my wet, sticky palms off that hot metal\u2026 it was clear that it didn't matter anyway. You ever see concrete boil? It doesn't, not really. But if you hit it with enough heat \u2014 hard enough, fast enough \u2014 it turns brown, then gets soft\u2026 and all the pockets of water in it, all the other chemicals, they start boiling and bursting free. Like big, wet pools of bubbling tar \u2014 belching out toxic fumes. The whole pipe alley was like that. The ground, the pillars \u2014 and the deinventory line's support struts. The fire-monitors were torching everything, and those torches were pointed right at all six struts. It was so hot that they had blasted the concrete off the steel beams . Five of the six beams were already slag. The line was sagging, just waiting for that last beam to give. Once it did, the deinventory line would snap \u2014 and dump half a million gallons of boiling, acidic poison right atop the pipe alley and into the heart of this city. I just stood there, surrounded by roaring flame, waiting for it to give. Waiting to die. Just trying to make peace with it \u2014 that we'd done all we could, and it still wasn't enough to stop us from killing everyone. So I kept waiting. And waiting. And waiting. And\u2026 \u2026I swear to God, it was ready to give. It was getting the worst of it. It was supposed to give. It had to give. By the end, it was glowing so bright I couldn't even look at it anymore. But\u2026 For three minutes, the last thing \u2014 the only thing \u2014 standing between ten thousand souls and all the fires of hell was that thin solitary beam of Bethlehem steel. And the beam did not give. Not one goddamn inch.",
