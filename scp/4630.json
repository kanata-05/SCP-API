The cell is to be partitioned to allow for private interviews with each of the objects, but have the ability to open to allow free communication when not conducting interviews.\n\n\nSCP-4630-2 is to be kept in a separate soundproof hydroponics containment cell. SCP-4630-2 is to have psychological evaluations on a biweekly basis, designed to investigate the extent of the object's knowledge. The attending psychologist is not allowed to bring pencil, paper, or any form of information storing devices with them to the evaluations. All meetings are to be recorded directly to encrypted drives set to Level-5 clearance only. After meeting with SCP-4630-2, the attending psychologist is to be treated with Class-C amnestics to remove all knowledge of their time spent with SCP-4630-2. Attending psychologists are to be rotated after every meeting.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4630 is a head of \nLactuca sativa\n, more commonly known as Iceberg Lettuce, which has gained sapience and a method of spoken communication through currently unknown, although suspected genetic\n1\n, means. Analysis of SCP-4630's genome has revealed substantial differences between its genetic code and that of a typical individual of \nL. sativa\n, collectively designated SCP-4630-A.\n\n\nInterviews with SCP-4630 have revealed that it believes itself to be a human researcher working at the Foundation under the name Doctor John Cabbage, although no such person was ever employed by the Foundation.\n\n\nExperiments with implanting different parts of the SCP-4630-A ANA\n2\n in additional subjects in the plant kingdom have resulted in additional sapient vegetables, designated SCP-4630-1 and SCP-4630-2. Due to the creation of SCP-4630-2, in spite of not being able to isolate the sapience granting string of genetic code, further experiments using this method have been suspended.\n\n\nSCP-4630, SCP-4630-1 and SCP-4630-2 have very little in common, apart from the following:\n\n\n\n\nAll of the objects have sapience.\n\n\nAll of the objects believe that they are human.\n\n\nAll of the objects believe that they have worked at the Foundation, despite no records existing to corroborate this.\n\n\nAll of the objects have names relating to the vegetable in a direct, or at least commonly misunderstood\n3\n, manner.\n\n\n\n\nFurther investigations into a connection between SCP-4630 and GoIs which have access to genetic modification technology is ongoing.\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n SCP-4630 was discovered in the lower most drawer of the refrigerator inside the Site-09 break room, when the object exclaimed he was being assaulted by a Junior Researcher as they were attempting to construct a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIO LOG 4630-A\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n 24 February 2017\n\n\nNOTE:\n Initial interview with SCP-4630. Dr. Chong presiding.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n Good morning, SCP-4630.\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n Good morning, Doctor\u2026 uh, Chong is it? I am Doctor Cabbage, and you may refer to me as such.\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n Very well, Doctor\u2026 Cabbage. Would you mind answering a few questions regarding your current state?\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n Oh, is it that bad? I thought I might be coming down with a cold. I was hoping that taking the day off would clear it up, but I suppose not.\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n I was referring to your current state of \n(pause)\n being a head of lettuce, Dr. Cabbage.\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n What? A head of lettuce?\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n Yes.\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n What are you talking about, Sir? I have never for a moment in my life ceased being a human being.\n\n\n(silence for approx. 15 seconds)\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n Dr. Cabbage, you describe yourself as a doctor, but would you mind telling me what you are a doctor of?\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n On my diploma it says Biological Sciences, but I was hired at the Foundation for my work on thaumaturgical biology.\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n Like DNA augmentation?\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n Through thaumaturgic means? Don't be silly, boy, that'd be impossible! The DNA structure is much too fine for the thaumaturgic methods we have today.\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n But you did work with DNA? Through non-thaumaturgic means?\n\n\nSCP-4630:\n I don't know where all this talk about DNA came from, I'm just a biologist, not a geneticist. I study the phenotypical traits of thaumaturgic creatures, fairies, unicorns, and the like. Classic stuff.\n\n\nDr. Chong:\n Alright, well\u2026 Thank you for your time, Dr. Cabbage.\n\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy order of Site Directorship\n\n\nRe: \nSCP-4630-1 Experiment\n\n\n\n\nThe experiment to extract a quantity of SCP-4630-A and implant it into another host, designated SCP-4630-1, is APPROVED.

Sigmund Peele.\n\n\nDr. Markson:\n So, D-057-\n\n\nSCP-4630-1:\n Oh, that's just like you doctor types to ask me my name just to go on and not fucking use it.\n\n\nDr. Markson:\n \n(pauses)\n Mr. Peele, would you describe where you were yesterday morning?\n\n\nSCP-4630-1:\n I don't know, probably in my fucking cell.\n\n\nDr. Markson:\n You don't remember?\n\n\nSCP-4630-1:\n No, I don't remember. Do you think you'd remember every time you stared at a grey concrete wall?\n\n\nDr. Markson:\n I see.

I figured if there was a god, he'd do this kind of cruel joke to me\u2026\n\n\nDr. Carlos:\n SCP-4630-2, please elaborate. What is particularly cruel?\n\n\nSCP-4630-2:\n The last thing I remember, I was lying in bed, which means I'm probably dead. I'd bet those bastards at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 did it too, they've been planning their little \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for years now, and I guess they finally built up the nerve to strike.\n\n\nDr. Carlos:\n I'm sorry, but, if you don't mind me asking, why would the \u2588\u2588\u2588 target you specifically?\n\n\nSCP-4630-2:\n Because I'm O5-\u2588, Joseph Cobb, you simpleton. \n(pause)\n I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.
