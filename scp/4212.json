A ballistic glass wall has been built two meters into the cell, to prevent researchers from having any further direct contact with SCP-4212.\n\nResearch on SCP-4212 must be done by two independent study groups, henceforth referred to as \u201cStudy Group A\u201d and \u201cStudy Group B.\u201d Study Group A consists of Doctor Atoz, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Junior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. These personnel are allowed free experimentation on SCP-4212 within reason and are allowed to enter its containment cell at any time of day. Study Group B consists of Agent Mints, Detective Hawley, and Junior Researcher L\u2019Engle. These personnel are strictly forbidden from any form of direct or indirect contact with SCP-4212 and must perform all of their research through secondary means, most prominently through interviews with Study Group A. No other Foundation personnel outside the O5 Council are allowed any interaction with SCP-4212.\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nNOTE: Any description of SCP-4212 written by anyone who has seen and/or experienced it seems entirely incomprehensible to anyone who has not. For this reason, a running commentary by Study Group B has been added. The commentary will provide leading theories as to what SCP-4212\u2019s description is attempting to convey. The description itself was written by Doctor Atoz, with Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2018proofreading.\u2019\n\n\nSCP-4212 is an incandescently-located variant of itself measuring approximately four meters tall, three hours wide, and seven gallons across. It has not been observed to possess any traditional geometry, however, it has been seen with two distinct faces and twenty-one corners, all except one located on an internal extremity on the body. It exists within itself and the to, so for now the a many and is in it be that with do at.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Commentary\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4212\u2019s geometry is entirely incoherent. The end of this paragraph is the first point in the description where Doctor Atoz stops writing in grammatically correct English, although both she and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were unable to find any errors when asked. It\u2019s entirely possible that SCP-4212 possesses some form of memetic quality that is making the act of describing it extremely difficult or impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4212 is agitated and extremely prone to existing. When it is placed under a sufficient amount of over, it will react in a nonbinary spatial-temporal-ephemeral-chemical manner, ending all negative functions and beginning to end to begin to end to begin to end to begin to end to begin to end. Individuals caught inside SCP-4212 will experience severe stability deterioration, followed by a loose conscious seam that eventually results in neutronic decay. This process lasts between three and twenty-one meters before the individual loses consciousness and it is found re-centralized within SCP-4212.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Commentary\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nNo consensus has been reached as to what \u2018extremely prone to existing\u2019 refers; however, describing the subject as \u2018agitated\u2019 implies that it may be hostile. More thorough surveillance of SCP-4212's containment chamber is recommended. The latter half of the paragraph seems to describe being \u2018caught inside\u2019 SCP-4212 and the dangers inherent in doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4212 is uncontained. SCP-4212 is uncontained. The Foundation is contained but SCP-4212 is free. SCP-4212. SCP-4212 will leave when it wants. SCP-4212 will take what it wants. SCP-4212 will make you like SCP-4212. 4212421242124212421242124212. The and a to, in is you that it he was for. It knows and understands its designation and wants to go between the outside of no. Changing the object class to Safe or Thaumiel is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Commentary\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\nStudy Group A has adamantly protested the removal of paragraph three, despite strong outside pressure to do so. It should be noted that, despite statement to the contrary, SCP-4212 is entirely and securely contained with little to no chance of breach. The O5 Council has overruled the suggestion to change the object class, and it will remain Euclid for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4212-1:\n As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Interview Log 4212-21 has been added to the SCP report.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a04212-21\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Doctor Atoz\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Mints\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nAgent Mints and Doctor Atoz enter an undisclosed meeting room within Site 19. Agent Mints is carrying a clipboard and pen, and is being fed questions by the others in Study Group B via earpiece.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n You wanted to see me, Mints?\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n You know why we\u2019re here.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Is this about SCP-4212?\n\n\nAgent Mints nods affirmative.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Oh, excellent! I\u2019m loving these little interviews. Really helps clear everything right up, don\u2019t you think?\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Right. Atoz, I\u2019m going to ask you some simple, yes-or-no questions concerning the subject. You are not to give any answers beyond \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no,\u2019 but you may skip questions if you feel neither answer applies. Do you understand?\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Well, sure!\n\n\nAgent Mints clicks his pen. Doctor Atoz coughs.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Is SCP-4212 alive?\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Pardon?\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Alive. Is SCP-4212 a living thing?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Not in the traditional sense of the word, I suppose not, although it does need to-\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Doctor Atoz, please stick with \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answers only.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n No.\n\n\nAgent Mints writes answer in clipboard.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Is SCP-4212 sentient?\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent Mints writes answer in clipboard.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Are our current containment measures for SCP-4212 effective?\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Yes.\n\n\nAgent Mints puts his pen to his clipboard, but does not write the answer.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Then why did you say it wasn't contained?\n\n\nAgent Mints is instructed to only ask the provided questions. Agent Mints does not acknowledge these instructions.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n I never said that.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n In the SCP report. You said SCP-4212 was uncontained twice.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n The SCP report?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Let's move on to the next question.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Let's.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Does SCP-4212 have any form of memetic effects?\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n \u2026Reports on the memetic effects of SCP-4212 have been entirely conclusive.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n And?\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n I'm sorry, could you clarify for me what 'memetic effects' are?\n\n\nAgent Mints writes on his clipboard for eleven seconds. It should be noted that every prewritten question has been asked at this point.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Atoz, I have one more question for you.\n\n\nAgent Mints is instructed to discontinue the interview.\n\n\nAgent Mints disables his earpiece.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Ask away.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n What is your first name, Doctor?\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n I'm sorry?\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n You heard me.\n\n\nPause.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n Mints, I'd\u2026 like to keep everything here on a professional basis, please.\n\n\nAgent Mints:\n Answer the question.\n\n\nDoctor Atoz:\n No.\n\n\nAgent Mints\n And why not?\n\n\nThe rest of Study Group B intervenes to end the interview. Agent Mints is reprimanded, and Doctor Atoz is ordered for psychological and medical testing.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4212-2a:\n Following Interview 4212-21, Agent Mints has been removed from Study Group B.\n\n\nAddendum 4212-2b:\n Following Interview 4212-21, medical analysis of Doctor Atoz was ordered. Doctor Atoz's body was found to have been deceased as of at least \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, yet still animate through unknown means.
