SCP-3050 is also monitored by security cameras placed across the perimeter, broadcasting live feed to Site-38. In the event of civilian discovery or containment breach, Mobile Task Force Psi-7 \"Home Improvement\" is to be dispatched to assess the situation and reestablish containment.\n\n\nSCP-3050's activation events are to be attributed to the local Foundation-owned S\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 weapons testing facility. At the beginning of activation, any personnel within the building are to evacuate within the 15 seconds allotted time period. Any personnel unable to escape within this time period are encouraged to make use of their issued cyanide tablets.\n\n\nAddendum 4.24.17:\n On 3/16/\u2588\u2588, two civilians were caught within SCP-3050 during its activation event after having seen a prior event and investigating. A 2.5 meter tall containment wall has been constructed around SCP-3050 per order of O5-\u2588\u2588 to prevent further information and containment breaches.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3050 is a large abandoned complex located in W\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, North Carolina, previously known as the \"Ogden School.\" SCP-3050's interior consists of typical furniture and appliances found in American schools between 1960-1976.\n\n\nSCP-3050 remains inert until its activation event, which occurs at random intervals any time of year. Preceding each activation, SCP-3050 will resound a 137 decibel alarm from an unknown source from within the facility for exactly 15 seconds. Following the alarm, all doors and windows close and are unable to be opened until the event has concluded. Upon closer investigation, \"locked\" exits fuse at the atomic level to walls and floors. From the exterior, all windows output a bright red light measured at an estimated 2,000 lumens. However, photon degradation occurs at .74 meters\n1\n within the perimeter of the facility; thereby limiting area of effect. Research regarding this anomalous light is ongoing.\n\n\nDuring the main phase of the event, all non-anomalous living human matter within SCP-3050 is reconstructed at the atomic level by means of selective reality degradation. This effect is achieved by means of precise anti-hume generators located in facilities constructed by Alexylva University. SCP-3050's event can last anywhere from 4 minutes to 2 hours. Testing logs and accounts state that the experience is painless. However, there is no consistency to the order in which body parts are reconstructed (or in the case of multiple subjects, which is reconstructed first.) Subjects undergoing reconstruction do not bleed or show wounds; all reconstructed body parts leave behind patched skin similar to post-amputation limbs.\n\n\nIndividuals reconstructed by SCP-3050 (designated SCP-3050-A) are integrated with objects and surfaces within the facility. Test logs and witness accounts prove that instances of SCP-3050-A are fully aware and retain most senses upon integration. Research concerning the termination of these individuals or a way to revert this effect is currently underway.\n\n\nAddendum 5.17/\u2588\u2588:\n\"Destruction of objects containing SCP-3050-A instances does not result in death of subject. Poor bastard, we broke the chair\u2026him. His pieces just won't stop screaming\u2026\" -Dr. Subin\n\n\nUpon completion of the event, all doors and windows unbind from their respective frame and a 110 decibel sound resembling wind chimes resounds from an unknown source outside the complex. SCP-3050 will stay inert for a minimum of 24 hours following the event. Exploration is only to be undertaken during this 24 hour grace period.\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 1/20/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubjects:\n D-19910, a political prisoner with experience in urban exploration\n\n\nEquipment:\n\n\n\n\nOne (1) Polaroid 600 printing camera.\n\n\nOne (1) Kant reality measuring device.\n\n\nOne (1) flashlight.\n\n\nOne (1) standard Foundation field ration.\n\n\nOne (1) standard issue pager.\n\n\nOne (1) item retrieval pack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin log\n>\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n Testing, testing- one, two, three.

What is your meter reading?\n\n\nD-19910:\n It's at one\u2026\"hume.\" Is that heat?\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n Ignore that. Continue exploring the facility.\n\n\n<\nD-19910 continues exploring the facility for [7.5] minutes. Nonessential content redacted.\n>\n\n\nD-19910:\n Doc, I'm hearing noises.

I'm in the school library\u2026something is odd in here.\n\n\nD-19910:\n There's\u2026something wrong with the far right corner of the room. It's like it's pitch black, but I can see everything in it clearly. It's shimmering a little bit, too; like a car hood in the hot sun. You know?\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n Walk closer to it while reading your meter.\n\n\nD-19910:\n It's decreasing very slowly as I walk towards it.

I'm in another hallway, but there's just one door at the end. I'm going in.\n\n\nD-19910:\n Oh, wow. I'm in the school's art room. Did you say this was an elementary school back in the day?\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n Yes, that's correct. Why?\n\n\nD-19910:\n There's a bunch of self portraits and\u2026statues on the walls and furniture. They're pretty great, especially for kids. I got a few pictures.\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n Is that all that's in there? Anything else?\n\n\nD-19910:\n Nah, just school supplies and the like. Hold on, doc\u2026the whispering and crying seem louder. Where's it coming from?\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n D-19910, investigate the self-portraits.\n\n\nD-19910:\n Why? They're just\u2026oh, shit. Doctor, they're moving.\n\n\nDr. Owens:\n Try and speak to one.\n\n\nD-19910:\n Is this some sort of joke? [to SCP-3050-A instances] Hey, can y'all hear me?\n\n\nSCP-3050-A:\n [No response.]\n\n\nD-19910:\n I'm leaving, this is a waste of time. It's just some dumb magic trick. [There is the sound of a small crash.]\n\n\nSCP-3050-A:\n [Childlike screaming.]\n\n\nD-19910:\n Oh, God. I-I tripped and landed on a table with one of the\u2026the things in it.
