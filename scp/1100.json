Despite being composed primarily of heavy proteins and [REDACTED], SCP-1100 is easily transmitted between plants via pollen, seeds, and other airborne elements, and over the course of 72 hours causes plants to become increasingly dangerous to human life.\n\n\nThe effects of SCP-1100 include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nAlterations to the appearance of edible plants that renders them repulsive to human observers.\n\n\nThe growth of hardened thorns and toughened structures in edible plants, rendering them inedible or indigestible to humans.\n\n\nThe internal manufacture of substances that cause nausea, pain, or severe internal injury to humans.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-1100 was first encountered following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, contaminating plants near human settlements near the affected region. It is currently unknown how SCP-1100 is able to specifically target humans with these adaptations, nor is it known what organization is responsible for the manufacture of SCP-1100. Research and additional funding have been allocated to investigate the source of SCP-1100.\n\n\nAddendum 1100-08:\n Incident Report: Loss of Bio-Containment Site 33\n\n\nDuring routine experimentation, a large amount of SCP-1100 spontaneously vaporized and infected the entire plant crop grown at Bio-Containment Site 33. The subsequent incident resulted in the complete loss of BCS-33, and casualties among 70% of site personnel before the breach was contained. BCS-33 has been decommissioned, and all remaining samples of SCP-1100 have been moved to Bio-Containment Site 26.\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFIED LEVEL 4 BY ORDER OF O5 COMMAND - EYES ONLY\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1100-023:\n Incident Log Addendum Re: Loss of Bio-Containment Site 26\n\n\nFrom fragments of damaged surveillance video recovered from the remains of Bio-Containment Site 26, it has been determined that the incident resulting in the total loss of BCS-26 was instigated by Drs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Access logs recovered from BCS-26's environmental systems then reported a breach in the primary service hub at 0637L, at which point SCP-1100 was presumably introduced into the entire site's air and water supply.\n\n\nInvestigation has turned up evidence of environmentalist organization membership for both Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
