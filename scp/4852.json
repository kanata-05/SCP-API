Objects relevant to Incident 4852.7 are stored in Site-19 Evidence Locker 38E.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4852 was an event that occurred on January 18th, 2013, that consisted of Foundation Site-19's Research Wing A spontaneously manifesting a proportionately sized pair of legs, superficially resembling those of a domesticated chicken. Research Wing A, provisionally designated SCP-4852-A, used these legs to tear itself from the rest of Site-19 before turning and running in a southwesterly direction at 21\u00a0km/h. A research conference had been scheduled in the wing, resulting in several prominent personnel gathered in the area during the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 4852.1\n\n\nAUDIO LOG 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25b6OPEN\u00a0ADDENDUM\u25c0\n\n\n\n\n\u25b7CLOSE\u25c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-MINUS 176 MINUTES, 26 SECONDS\n\n\n\u00abBEGIN LOG\u00bb\n\n\n\n\nMIC 1\n\n\nBRIGHT:\n Got any sixes?\n\n\nCLEF:\n Nah, go fish.\n\n\nKONDRAKI:\n This game sucks.\n\n\nBRIGHT:\n I'm trying to enjoy my break.

    "description": "SCP-4852 was an event that occurred on January 18th, 2013, that consisted of Foundation Site-19's Research Wing A spontaneously manifesting a proportionately sized pair of legs, superficially resembling those of a domesticated chicken. Research Wing A, provisionally designated SCP-4852-A, used these legs to tear itself from the rest of Site-19 before turning and running in a southwesterly direction at 21\u00a0km/h. A research conference had been scheduled in the wing, resulting in several prominent personnel gathered in the area during the event.",
