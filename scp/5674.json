Conduits of SR #5674 found in the possession of the public are to be confiscated; if the offender is repentant, no further action will be necessary. The conduits are constituted of simple ordained matter and may be held at any reliquary or holding site within a locked box.\n\n\nEcumenical personnel \nare allowed to own, forge, and use conduits of SR #5674 at their own free will\n are permitted to use conduits of SR #5674 for the purpose of inquisition under the guidance of the cult of Saint Hubertus.\n\n\nDescription:\n SR #5674 is an aspect of Saint Hubertus\n1\n which can be accessed through the ritual use of a conduit to his animus. An SR #5674 conduit is a sealable box forged from brass, of any dimensions, with a concave lens which allows a line of sight into its interior.\n\n\nThe conduit must be blessed in the name of Saint Hubertus\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Father,\n\nInfinite and indivisible,\n\nOut of your heart emerges everything\n\nFrom the vastness of the expanse\n\nTo the smallest grain of sand.\n\n\n \n\nMighty Father,\n\nTo see all that is unseen;\n\nThe motions of worlds\n\nAnd the trajectories of light's rays;\n\nIs to know the sum of your works.\n\n\n \n\nBlessed Father,\n\nIn the name of Saint Hubertus;\n\nWho holds the keys to burn away madness,\n\nWho sees everything,\n\nAnd who guards the forest of Gnosis;\n\nMay we see what he can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the blessing is heeded, Saint Hubertus will consume the offering\n2\n and answer in kind, such that the conduit will become a sink for His Providence and foresight. Upon sealing the relic\n3\n of an individual inside the conduit, the lens will reveal moving tridimensional images which defy the limits of the conduit's interior space. These images depict a possible world and its consequences wherein the individual connected to the relic was never conceived, so that we may reflect on their impact.\n\n\nAddendum #5674.I\u2014 Inquisitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nRelic\n\n\nProvidence Granted\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/07/1834\n\n\nI; Skin from the \nInquisitor Caius Griffiths\n\n\nAn idyllic montane countryside.

The Antichrist was disrobed, defanged and declawed, his eyes gouged, and, so cast before a congregation of his enemies, was shot and baptised in fire. The cult of Saint Hubertus sampled his residue, so that they may be granted Providence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidue\n\n\nProvidence Granted\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nst\n\n\nII; Writhing vestments of the \nKing of Magog\n\n\nGlass and metal towers with tops in the sky above streets with soulless people. The beaches and waterways of Mare Nostrum are dyed and polluted by refuse. Beasts of air and sea are choked by an iridescent black miasma which floats on the water. A cross inside a halo floats above the heads of the helpers of God's creatures.\n\n\nProvidence seems to resemble the 51\nst\n Circle of Sheol. Residue was destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nth\n\n\nII; The hearts, the 3\nrd\n eye, the 13\nth\n digit, and the womb of the \nKing of Magog\n\n\nAn orange mushroom growing from the ruins of a city. Iram of the Pillars reemerging to forge the Earth in her false clockwork image. Half-bodied golems in the sky crushing the citadels of Palaest\u012bna under their fists. A cabal of smiling Daemons wearing the skins of men and the robes of bishops. Sol breaking through the Firmament and melting our flesh. Wormwood, the Leviathan of New Daevastan, blazing like a torch, regurgitating beasts and turning the seas blue and turbulent.\n\n\nAll attempts at misdirection. Residue was destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nth\n\n\nI; The Crown of Tongues of the \nKing of Magog\n\n\nThe Synod of the Tridecimate murdered by lead bullets. The bodies are placed in coffins draped under an unknown flag with three crescents.\n\n\nPathetic mockery. Residue was destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\nth\n\n\nI; Ashes of the \nKing of Magog\n\n\n \n[POTENTIAL HAZARD OF MIND PURGED]\n \nProverbs 27:12\n\u2013 The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it.\n\n\nThe Daemon blasphemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following days, the city of Ierusalem rejoiced, for it was scorched free of deceivers and tyrants and the abominable Larvae of Tartarus.\n\n\nThree days after this Providence, to punctuate the ceremonies of Resurrection Sunday, the Synod of the Tridecimate threw the ashes of the \nKing of Magog\n into the expanse beyond the Firmament, that he may never return. May all heathens learn humility from his grisly and deserved end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Corinthians 4:18\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we look not to the things that are seen,\n\nBut to the things that are unseen.\n\nFor the things that are seen are transient,\n\nBut the things that are unseen are eternal.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. c. 656 \u2013 30 May 727 ann\u014d Domin\u012b.
