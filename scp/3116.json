Personnel will then isolate the affected accounts, determine all senders and recipients of SCP-3116 to/from that account, and then amnesticize the account operator(s) as necessary. Servers of affected internet services, as well as all computers that may contain SCP-3116, should be searched manually for SCP-3116; SCP-3116 should then be deleted.\n\n\nA transcription of SCP-3116 itself is attached to this document and can be accessed by personnel with clearance 3/3116 \n[INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE]\n or higher.\n\n\nIn emergency situations, MTF Omicron-12 (\"\nNine-Tailed Dox\n\") is authorized to use SCP-2726 to temporarily disable hostile actors operating over the internet. In these situations, SCP-3116 should be accompanied by an appropriate antimeme to prevent further spread of SCP-3116.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3116 is a seventy-character alphanumeric string with no apparent linguistic content. When sent as a private/direct message to an account on an internet service, the recipient will be forcibly logged out and their connection to the service in question terminated. Any individuals actively monitoring this event will experience a myoclonic jerk\n1\n and the brief sensation of falling as it occurs. No unusual physical or psychological changes have been observed in individuals who receive SCP-3116.\n\n\nRepeated manual transmission of SCP-3116 can cause a condition (designated SCP-3116-A) in some subjects, characterized by chronic somnambulism and occasional hallucinations. During the REM phase of sleep, individuals subject to SCP-3116-A will attempt to access one or more internet services that they regularly use\n2\n and operate them as normal. While subjects display limited awareness of content they access during this state, their ability to interpret and respond to this content in a 'normal' fashion is greatly diminished, resulting in unusual behavior.\n\n\nThose subject to SCP-3116-A will, at a rate of about once per day, visually and aurally hallucinate textually described events as occurring to them or in their immediate vicinity.\n3\n These hallucinations last for 5-30 seconds and are distinguishable from reality only by contextual information, typically their sudden occurrence and non-sequitur nature.\n\n\nWhile no treatment for SCP-3116-A has been identified, symptoms wear off after 2-3 weeks so long as the subject does not transmit SCP-3116. Even a single SCP-3116 transmission can cause an immediate relapse in previously cured subjects.\n\n\nAll tested search algorithms ignore SCP-3116's presence, negating attempts to automatically detect it or prevent its spread.\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-3116 was first found circulating the internet in June of 2016, by which point an estimated 8,500 accounts had either sent or received SCP-3116. Initial containment efforts were hindered by SCP-3116's immunity to automated identification and removal, mandating manual identification, interviewing, and amnesticization of all affected subjects; consequently, the population affected by SCP-3116 expanded by an additional ~2,500 individuals before growth could be halted.\n\n\nDue to similarities between SCP-3116's 'invisibility' to search algorithms and that exhibited by \nSCP-2726\n, a connection to Gamers Against Weed was hypothesized early on, and was used to guide early-stage searches for affected subjects. While this link has not been proven conclusively, chat logs uploaded anonymously to a file-sharing site on 2016-09-15 suggest that it was originally produced by the user \"gaycopmp4\" and distributed among members of the group.\n\n\nThe aforementioned documents are reproduced below, with additional formatting applied for readability. Note that the veracity of these documents cannot be verified, and they may or may not contain factual information.\n\n\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n hey vro check this out\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged out.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n success\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged in.\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n what the fuck\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n it's a thing you can send to people and make them log out\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n happyb irthday\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n oh hell yes\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n tyvm\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n i mean i maed this like 3 months ago\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n and then forgot about it until that time you mentioned that one podcast\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n hey, it's my birthday. at least let me feel special lol\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n no\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n also make sure not to use it for evil or anything\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n loud and clear\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\ngaycopmp4 logged out.\n\ngaycopmp4 logged in.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n why you little\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged out.\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged in.\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\ngaycopmp4 logged out.\n\ngaycopmp4 logged in.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged out.\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged in.\n\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\ngaycopmp4 logged out.\n\ngaycopmp4 logged in.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n [SCP-3116 REMOVED]\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged out.\n\nCommunismAnarchismNihilism logged in.\n\n\n[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbones:\n Are you busy right now?\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n yeah\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n on life\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n sorry i completely misread your message\n\n\nbones:\n You're forgiven.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n i am not busy\n\n\nbones:\n Several users have issued complaints regarding your forcible log-off trick.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n just tell them to stop sending it\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n like seirously you have my blessing its getitng annoying\n\n\nbones:\n I did, and they claim that they're attempting to comply.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n what\n\n\nbones:\n Apparently, some of the repeated 'users' of the trick have been joining the chat in their sleep.\n\n\nbones:\n In addition to the expected unusual behavior, some have continued to send the trick while in this state.\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n is that why harmpit spendt an hour last night talking about twinkies\n\n\nbones:\n No, he later attributed that to an edible.
