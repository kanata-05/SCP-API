Should a community infected with SCP-3089 be identified, a joint operation involving \nMTF Mu-4 (\"Debuggers\")\n, MTF Nu-13 (\"Rasczak's Roughnecks\"), and \nMTF Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\")\n is to be conducted to contain all members of this community and remove all evidence of its existence from the public record.\n\n\nPrior to shedding their epidermis, SCP-3089-A instances are to be confined to standard human containment cells. Instances in Stage II are to be remotely monitored by Foundation medical staff on a 48-hour cycle to monitor their progression.\n\n\nStage III instances are to be transferred to HTH containment cells\n1\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3089 is a phenomenon that emerges among communities focused on developing methods to acquire physical, financial, and social prosperity. Although its precise pathology is not yet understood, affected communities are identified by several markers \u2014 the most prominent of which is a fixation on achieving material success via the application of \nrituals\n associated with the \nC\u00e9tlaid\u00ed\n, or \"Singers\" (a Druidic cult active in Ireland between the 15th and 19th centuries).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3089-A instance (Stage III, post-autopsy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3089-A instances are members of an affected community afflicted with SCP-3089-B \u2014 a form of chimerism incorporating exogenous genetic material from the \nCicadetta montana\n, or New Forest cicada. SCP-3089-B emerges in accordance to the following progression:\n\n\n\n\nStage I:\n \nChrysalis.\n The instance enters a state of severely depressed metabolism, brain activity, heart-rate, and body temperature. Over a period of 3-6 hours, the instance's epidermis hardens into a dense, brittle shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage II:\n \nMetamorphosis.\n Numerous small internal teratomas manifest within the instance. Over a period of 2-3 weeks, these tumors expand and dissolve surrounding soft tissue, replacing all functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage III:\n \nEmergence\n. Once the majority of soft tissue has been replaced, the instance exits its dormant state, exuviates its outer epidermal shell, and emerges. It is now non-communicative, and will attempt to burrow into soil via any means at its disposal.\n\n\n\n\nAt Stage III, numerous organs (including eyes, lungs, and internal genitalia) are now vestigial; examination of the brain shows severe deviations from topographical norms.\n\n\nSCP-3089 was first discovered by the Foundation in 1961 following the disappearance of an entire town's population in North Carolina. This town has since been demolished, and the region surrounding it purchased for observation.\n\n\nAddendum 3089.1:\n Ministry of the Sevenfold Blessing\n\n\nThe following audio was recovered from magnetic cassettes found in the offices of the Ministry of the Sevenfold Blessing, located in Darrington, North Carolina (USA).

I want to talk to you about what you are owed. I want to talk to you about\u2026 I want to talk to those of you who are struggling, right now. To those of you who have hardship and pain. Maybe you've heard that the Bible only nourishes the spirit; that God provides only for our immortal souls. Well, my friends, I am here to tell you that this is simply not true.\"\n\n\n\"You are a child of the most High God; the King of Kings. He has breathed His very life into you; His royal blood flows through your veins. He did not create you to just 'get by'. You are His child. You are His champion. He put you here to rise\u2026 to rise up and achieve \ntotal victory\n.\"\n\n\n\"Many of you can think of places in your lives where you have not yet risen. Where you are not yet victorious.

What does this tell us? That the Lord casts aside those wicked servants who are content with mediocrity; those who do not seek to enrich their Master's possessions. Those who do not seek total victory.\"\n\n\n\"We are God's investment; it falls upon us to be a profitable one. He gave His only begotten Son, surrendered Him to the earth, so that He might rise from it and grant us life everlasting. We must demonstrate the wisdom and glory of this sacrifice, this investment.\"\n\n\n\"Now, some of you have expressed concerns over the new sacraments.

This isn't some sort of 'Dumbo's Magic Feather' confidence trick, either. I'm just talking neurology. I'm just talking science. It's just how we're wired.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n Right. I mean, yeah, a lot of people don't \u2014\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n But when you approach a woman and you're hoping to \u2014\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n It's like she unconsciously picks up on it.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n \u2014 sleep with her \u2014 right, yeah. It's similar to Van Eck Phreaking, which means you can block it. That's Mystery's stick, with his hats. He lines them with steel mesh. (\nlaughing\n) You think I'm joking. But yeah, an alternative approach is to retrain your brain. \nKnow\n you're sleeping with her. Because if you're hoping \u2014\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n That means you're selling.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Right! And women aren't looking to buy. They're looking to be bought.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n (\nlaughing\n) Jesus, that sounds bad.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n I know, right? But yeah.

Right.\n\n\nVOICE 2:\n \u2014 you should always aim for the ten.\n\n\nVOICE 1:\n Right. A lot of us walk into a room, see a ten, do a basic probability matrix, and tell ourselves: 'Okay, I've got no chance, I'll focus on the 7 or 8 LSE in the corner'. And that's just bullshit.

Always go for the ten. Never sell yourself short. I mean, we're all products of evolution \u2014 a four billion year old iterative process dedicated to perfecting our ability to pass on our genes. We weren't put here to go for sevens and eights, you know? We're not here to win 2nd place. Go platinum or go extinct. Be a champion \u2014 or get out of the champion's way.

I want to talk to you about what you are owed. I want to talk to you about\u2026 I want to talk to those of you who are struggling, right now. To those of you who have hardship and pain. Maybe you've heard that the Bible only nourishes the spirit; that God provides only for our immortal souls. Well, my friends, I am here to tell you that this is simply not true.\" \"You are a child of the most High God; the King of Kings. He has breathed His very life into you; His royal blood flows through your veins. He did not create you to just 'get by'. You are His child. You are His champion. He put you here to rise\u2026 to rise up and achieve total victory .\" \"Many of you can think of places in your lives where you have not yet risen. Where you are not yet victorious. Marriage. Finances. Health. But do not fret, my friends. God wants you to rise. He has cleared the path for you. It is one littered with His earthly treasures; to claim them, you need only to shed your old selves and be reborn.\" \"Now, if you would \u2014 some of the ladies from the \u2014 thank you, ladies \u2014 some of the ladies from the mayor's office were kind enough to collect these cicada shells. Pass them along. Each of you take one \u2014 yes, the children too. Be careful. Very careful. They are fragile. Each of you, take one, and hold it in your left hand. Yes. The left hand, not the right. Your left.\" \"Good. I want you to all close your eyes. Please, everyone. Close your eyes. I want you to visualize\u2026 I want you to imagine whatever hardship in your life you're struggling with, right now. Picture it. What is it? Your job? Your car? Your marriage? Is someone in your household sick? Picture it in your left hand. Picture yourself holding that problem\u2026\" \"\u2026now, I want you to squeeze your left hand. Squeeze it into a fist. Feel that problem cracking; like old, dried out paper. Feel it crumble to dust.\" \"Everyone, open your eyes. Don't you feel better? Stronger? This is what is offered. Our hardships are like the shell; we shall cast them aside even as they crumble. God has cleared a path. Amen. Amen.\"",

Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.'\" \"Both Heaven and earth are God's possessions; we are but tenants upon His property. Just as the angels are God's Heavenly servants, so are we His earthly ones.\" \"In chapter twenty-five of Matthew, verse thirty \u2014 the Parable of the Talents \u2014 God speaks: 'And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' What does this tell us? That the Lord casts aside those wicked servants who are content with mediocrity; those who do not seek to enrich their Master's possessions. Those who do not seek total victory.\" \"We are God's investment; it falls upon us to be a profitable one. He gave His only begotten Son, surrendered Him to the earth, so that He might rise from it and grant us life everlasting. We must demonstrate the wisdom and glory of this sacrifice, this investment.\" \"Now, some of you have expressed concerns over the new sacraments. A few \u2014 I will not say who, but a few \u2014 have even called them sacrilege. And yet, have we not prospered? Have these same nay-sayers \u2014 again, I will not speak their names \u2014 but have these same 'Doubting Thomases' not profited from our good works?\" \"I have shown you how to heal the sick with the Lord's Prayer and the blood of an unbaptized child. I have shown you how to see your future in the steaming entrails of a quivering crow. I have shown you the path to glory. But I cannot make you follow this path. I can only show it to you; it is you and you alone who must follow it \u2014 who must rise and shed your old self.\"",

Now, I'm giving lectures in front of my Porsche, inside my six-car garage, attached to my 2.3 million dollar home. Do you want to know how I do it? All I had to do was climb the ladder. All I had to do was think positively.\" [00:08:50]: \"Ladders exist so you can climb them. That's what ladders are for, people! The universe is telling you it wants you to prosper. You just have to visualize success \u2014 and success will come. That's the power of positive thinking.\" [00:12:09]: \"If you're not going for the top of that ladder, then this video isn't for you. Bye! Sorry to have wasted your time. Successful people don't deal with losers. Only keep watching if you want to achieve complete mastery over your life.\" [00:18:22]: \"Recent developments in quantum physics have demonstrated the impact of human consciousness on our universe.

The community was later determined to be affected by SCP-3089. [BEGIN LOG] VOICE 1: One of the things a lot of us don't seem to get \u2014 not even veterans \u2014 is that women are wired to want to sleep with you. This isn't some sort of 'Dumbo's Magic Feather' confidence trick, either. I'm just talking neurology. I'm just talking science. It's just how we're wired. VOICE 2: Right. I mean, yeah, a lot of people don't \u2014 VOICE 1: But when you approach a woman and you're hoping to \u2014 VOICE 2: It's like she unconsciously picks up on it. VOICE 1: \u2014 sleep with her \u2014 right, yeah. It's similar to Van Eck Phreaking, which means you can block it. That's Mystery's stick, with his hats. He lines them with steel mesh. ( laughing ) You think I'm joking. But yeah, an alternative approach is to retrain your brain. Know you're sleeping with her. Because if you're hoping \u2014 VOICE 2: That means you're selling. VOICE 1: Right! And women aren't looking to buy. They're looking to be bought. VOICE 2: ( laughing ) Jesus, that sounds bad. VOICE 1: I know, right? But yeah. It's just science. VOICE 2: Another thing you've mentioned before is how \u2014 how you should never aim low. You should always \u2014 VOICE 1: Oh. Right. VOICE 2: \u2014 you should always aim for the ten. VOICE 1: Right. A lot of us walk into a room, see a ten, do a basic probability matrix, and tell ourselves: 'Okay, I've got no chance, I'll focus on the 7 or 8 LSE in the corner'. And that's just bullshit. Aim for the ten. You always aim for the ten. Because if you don't \u2014 VOICE 2: Then you're not trying to be the best you that you can possibly be. VOICE 1: Right. Exactly. Always go for the ten. Never sell yourself short. I mean, we're all products of evolution \u2014 a four billion year old iterative process dedicated to perfecting our ability to pass on our genes. We weren't put here to go for sevens and eights, you know? We're not here to win 2nd place. Go platinum or go extinct. Be a champion \u2014 or get out of the champion's way. If you're not gonna play hard, then you might as well just remove yourself from the gene-pool. VOICE 2: ( laughing ) Okay there, Richard Dawkins. So, I have to ask \u2014 VOICE 1: About the bug-rattler, right? VOICE 2: Yeah. How'd you guess? VOICE 1: A lot of people have been asking me about it. Here, I've got one on me. VOICE 2: Uh, wow. So what \u2014 [STATIC] VOICE 2: Jesus, that's loud! VOICE 1: Yeah. It's the preserved remains of a Cicadetta montana , which is just a fancy word for those really big, loud bugs that burrow and leave their shells everywhere. See these structures on the side? Those are 'tymbals'. The male cicada uses them to attract mates. ( laughing ) Well, I do, too. VOICE 2: This seriously works? VOICE 1: Yeah. This is actually \u2014 I actually came across this when I was doing research for my next book, Negging Your Immune System: How To Use Pick-Up Techniques To Win At Life . VOICE 2: ( laughing ) That's one hell of a title. VOICE 1: Ain't it, though? My publicist came up with it. She's fucking amazing. Anyway, yeah, the book's all about applying seduction techniques more broadly throughout your life. It's crazy how this stuff can apply everywhere \u2014 you can use the same tricks in finances, health \u2014 even to develop yourself spiritually. VOICE 2: ( laughing ) \u2026you're not going to try and pick up God, are you? VOICE 1: ( laughing ) I mean, if he were a chick, I probably would. VOICE 2: So, this bug-rattler \u2014 you figured this trick out from your studies? VOICE 1: Yeah. Here, you can keep it, I've got a couple. Just, ah \u2014 VOICE 2: Oh, cool. VOICE 1: \u2014 ah, don't \u2014 don't use it around the same chick too many times, y'know? If you do \u2014 sometimes they'll end up\u2026 ( laughing ) They'll start chittering and hissing, shit like that. VOICE 2: Oh, wow. VOICE 1: ( laughing ) Yeah, it's \u2014 VOICE 2: That's pretty, uh \u2014 VOICE 1: It's kind of gross, yeah. So just be responsible with it, y'know? VOICE 2: Right. I will, thanks.
