SCP-4446-A is stored inside a standard damp free containment container located on Site-12.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4446 is a 792x495 bitmap (.bmp) image of a Mei\u00dfner Landschwein pig. In most cases SCP-4446 behaves as a normal .bmp file. These cases include copy and pasting, moving inside of SCP-4446-A, renaming and observing its code via any method.\n\n\nSCP-4446 cannot be deleted or edited. Any attempt to do so is prompted by an alert that sufficient administrative rights are needed, even if executed as an admin. Methods of bypassing this alert have so far been unsuccessful or resulted in non-anomalous duplicates of SCP-4446.\n\n\nThe anomalous effect of SCP-4446 occurs when observing it via any image viewing software that supports zooming by mouse clicks, key binds or buttons, including photo galleries, image editing softwares, games that use SCP-4446 as a texture and browsers.\n\n\nSCP-4446 can possibly be zoomed into indefinitely, as SCP-4446 is fractally defined. Each pixel that would normaly make up an image is itself an image of SCP-4446, and the 'pixels' making that sub-image up, are again images of SCP-4446. These sub-images are tinted accordingly.\n1\n\n\nNotably some of these pixels depict something else than SCP-4446, albeit still related to pigs in some way. These are mostly different breeds and species of pigs, including wild boars, various landraces, bearded pigs, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and others as well as text concerning pigs.\n\n\nZooming into a specific image (in other words any specific pixel) depicting something else than SCP-4446 will result in new sub-images being related to that specific image. See test logs for examples.\n\n\nZooming into SCP-4446 takes increasingly more effort for SCP-4446-A to process. SCP-4446-A becomes too slow to properly work with after a magnitude of roughly \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 1\n\n\nTest 2\n\n\nTest 3\n\n\nTest 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch:\n Frontview of an unidentified Mei\u00dfner Landschwein\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\n\n\nImage of a pig tongue\n\n\nImage of a Mei\u00dfner Landschwein behind a fence\n\n\nImage of two Mei\u00dfner Landschwein eating unidentifiable food\n\n\n\nFurther zooming reveals food is maize\n\n\nZooming also shows text spelling 'yuck'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of a pig carcass hanging in a butcher shop\n\n\nText spelling 'pig'\n\n\nText spelling 'piqpie'\n\n\n\nImage of a pie\n\n\nText spelling 'delicio'\n\n\nText spelling 'use'\n\n\n\nText spelling 'piq'\n\n\nText spelling 'bacon'\n\n\n\nImage of bacon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch:\n Visayan warty pig (abbreviation: VWP)\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\n\n\nImage of hair similar to that of VWP\n\n\n\nImage of multiple VWP hiding inside the flakes of dandruff of said hair\n\n\n\nAnother angle of the previous image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of pig excrement\n\n\nImage of a VWP eating dirt\n\n\nImage of two VWP mating\n\n\nImage of a pig stomach\n\n\nText spelling 'pig'\n\n\nText spelling 'help'\n\n\n\nImage of an expressionless cartoon VWP holding up a sign spelling 'help'\n\n\n\nImage of the same VWP lying dead on the floor\n\n\n\nImage of the same VWP rotting on the floor\n\n\n\nImage of the same VWP's skeleton lying on the floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of an expressionless cartoon VWP piglet holding up a sign spelling 'help'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch:\n A sleeping boar\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\n\n\nImage of a boar eating dirt\n\n\nImage of several boar piglets running around\n\n\n\nImage of several boar piglets sleeping\n\n\nText spelling 'early'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of two boars eating\n\n\nImage of a boar piglet being born\n\n\nImage of a boar tusk\n\n\nImage of several boars eating\n\n\n\nImage of a boar stomach\n\n\n\nImage of fishbones\n\n\nText spelling 'yum'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText spelling 'pig'\n\n\nText spelling 'piq'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch:\n Dr. Fisher alongside a Mei\u00dfner Landschwein\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\n\n\nImage of a Mei\u00dfner Landschwein eating\n\n\nImage of a pig's eye\n\n\n\nText spelling 'look'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of Dr. Fisher's face, smiling\n\n\nImage of a pig snout\n\n\n\nText spelling 'back'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of three Mei\u00dfner Landschwein standing in mud\n\n\nImage of a boar fighting a caveman\n\n\nImage of Dr. Fisher having intercourse with a Mei\u00dfner Landschwein\n\n\n\nImage of Dr. Fisher's face, ecstatic\n\n\n\nText spelling '\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Farm'\n\n\nImage of Dr. Fisher's face, content\n\n\n\nText spelling 'pig'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n \nDr. Fisher requested the removal of these logs and permanent discontinuation of research on SCP-4446.

Although from afar this is the case, the further one zooms into any such black pixel, the more it lightens up and gains color. When the sub-image covers the entire viewing field, its colors are virtually identical to the original image. Zooming out reverses this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4445\n | SCP-4446 | \nSCP-4447\n \u00bb",
