Significant distortion occurs when attempting to record or photograph an apparition event.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Personnel are to allow SCP-5491 to manifest for three hours each night. The Foundation has supplied a modest library of taped and vinyl music, appropriate to the tastes of SCP-5491-1.\n\n\nThe building containing SCP-5491 has been purchased by the Foundation and granted Listed status, exempting it from being considered for demolition by the local authority. Soundproofing materials have been installed to curb external interest in SCP-5491 occurrences.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5491 is a spectral phenomenon relating to the disused \u2018Aspekt\u2019 nightclub and discotheque near Burry Port, Wales.\n\n\nThe venue\u2019s original lighting and sound systems remain in place, and SCP-5491 occurs when a specific sequence of strobe presets is activated. SCP-5491 consists, at present, of thirteen humanoid apparitions (designated collectively as SCP-5491-1). A new entity has appeared, on average, every three years since the anomaly came to the Foundation's attention.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-5491-1 manifest as teenagers or adolescents, dressed in clothing typical of the late 1970s and early 1980s. SCP-5491-1 demonstrate a significant level of spatial awareness, often making way for corporeal individuals to pass, but have otherwise made no attempts to interact with researchers. It is, however, possible for people and objects to phase through SCP-5491-1 when the entities are caught off-guard.\n\n\nSCP-5491 is constrained to the venue\u2019s dance floor, where entities will dance for an as-yet indeterminate period of time if club or disco music from the era is played over the sound system. When the music is turned off, or a song from a different era or genre is played, SCP-5491-1 become agitated and will occasionally heckle in the direction of the disc jockey booth. Terminating the strobe sequence will cause the apparition to cease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a007/01/18\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a007/01/18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Barry Williams\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr Leonard Bertram\n\n\nForeword:\n Posing as a historian, Dr Bertram arranged an interview with lifelong local resident Barry Williams. Mr Williams had been identified as a former patron using photographs taken of the venue in the early 1980s, but did not resemble any instances of SCP-5491-1.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n Hi, Mr Williams. I\u2019m Leo, we spoke on the phone?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Of course, come in. I\u2019ve got the kettle on, if you\u2019d-\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n Oh, no thanks. I shan\u2019t take too long.\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Take as long as you need.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n Okay, well\u2026 about this photograph.\n\n\nDr Bertram pulls out a photocopied Polaroid showing the club\u2019s interior in its heyday, with several individuals circled who bear close similarity to instances of SCP-5491-1.\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Yeah, that\u2019s Aspekt alright. Such a shame it\u2019s fallen into\u2026 disrepair.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n And that\u2019s you in the corner?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n God, those bell-bottoms. Yep, that\u2019s me. They were barely in fashion even then.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n Now, about these people I\u2019ve put circles around\u2026\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Let me see\u2026 well, I couldn\u2019t tell you who those two fellows on the left are, I\u2019m afraid. But that lady, over here \u2013 I\u2019d recognise Linda Hartford a mile away. Poor old Linda\u2026\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n Where\u2019s Linda now, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Oh, she was a lovely girl. Half the town must\u2019ve fancied her back in the day. In year ten I went out with her for, what, about two weeks I reckon. She moved away at the start of the eighties, like most of them did, and a couple of years ago I heard she passed away.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n I\u2019m sorry, Mr Williams.\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n I\u2019m fine. It was a\u2026 drunk driving incident, I think. As in, she was the driver. A lot of the old crowd ended up on the bottle, but poor Linda had trouble for years.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n You mentioned that a lot of these people moved away?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Yeah, when Thatcher and her lot started closing the mines. We knew the town was on the chopping block, and by the time it \ndid\n come around, a lot of the younger folks had moved out to the cities. Swansea, Cardiff\u2026 some of the ones who could afford it went to university. Most of them never came back.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n And you stayed?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n We just didn\u2019t have the money. My dad, he was an excavator mechanic, until the mine closed down. And everything he taught me about engines, well, I\u2019ve been at the town garage for getting on four decades now.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n What about this gentleman, the one next to Linda?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Oh, Thomas. Thomas Langford. He was a proper gent, old Tommy. You know, he was one of the first people in Wales to die of AIDS? That\u2019s a grim little tidbit for your history book.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n That\u2019s\u2026 terrible. You don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anyone else who\u2019s, how should I put this, \nstill around\n that I might be able to talk to?\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Oh, I\u2019ve not been in contact with most of the old lot in years. They\u2019re all over the place, now \u2013 London, all that, became proper city folk. They won\u2019t be interested in coming back here, I don\u2019t think.\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n That\u2019s a shame. I'd love to be able to speak to some of them.\n\n\nBarry Williams takes a sip of his tea.\n\n\nBarry Williams:\n Do you know how much damage Thatcher did to this town? It\u2019s anger, that\u2019s what keeps me going. I\u2019ll stay here as long as it means this place doesn\u2019t \ncompletely\n become a ghost town\u2014\n\n\nDr Bertram:\n I\u2019ve, uh, gotta make a move now. Thank you ever so much for your time, Mr Williams \u2013 this has been a great help to my research.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\nBarry Williams passed away at his home on 27/08/19. The cause of death was verified as a diagnosed heart condition. The following evening, personnel in charge of SCP-5491\u2019s routine observation recorded the manifestation of a fourteenth spectral entity, which bore resemblance to Barry Williams in photographs circa 1981.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5490\n | SCP-5491 | \nSCP-5492\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5491\n\" by ThisMightBeAuto, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
