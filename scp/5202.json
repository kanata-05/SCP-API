The vault has been fitted with a Lexon-Anderson Vacuum Array (LAVA), to ensure 100% auditory cancelation.\n\n\nIf the LAVA experiences a loss of power or mechanical malfunction, all personnel on Site-51's sublevels one through six are to wear Class-2a auditory protection headsets until containment is reestablished.\n\n\nThe Site-51 PoI Apprehension Unit is to continue tracking PoI-5202/A and PoI-5202/B to facilitate their capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nSCP-5202 is a synthetic fowl imitation prop enhanced by a continuous audiothurgic process, housed within its internal acoustic device. This process amplifies SCP-5202's auditory function to 170-190 decibels. SCP-5202 is highly damage resistant and there is currently no known method of deactivating it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nSCP-5202 came to Foundation attention when assets in the Ohio State Police reported a strange auditory phenomenon affecting the town of Cadbern. Civilians filed several noise complaints regarding a loud \"croaking noise\" that could be heard for miles. Local residence believed the sound originated from the Duepur Corporation's\n1\n headquarters, located 3.2\u00a0km West of Cadbern. The OSP assets forwarded an audio file of the event, background noise has been removed for clarity:\n\n\n\n\nMobile Task Force Mu-24 (\"Hear no Evil\") was deployed to locate and contain the source of the phenomenon. The following is a video transcript of SCP-5202's recovery:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u274f\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0\u274f\n\n\n\n\n\u2750\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0\u2750\n\n\n\n\nDate | Time:\n 2020/06/01 | 13:45 GMT\n\n\nDepicted:\n \u03bc-24/1, \u03bc-24/2, \u03bc-24/3, \u03bc-24/4\n\n\nForeword:\n Due to SCP-5202, all audio has been removed.

We have no issues with people eating meat, but there's a better way to do it than this. There has to be. Maybe up there at headquarters, the big wigs can't hear the chickens' screams for mercy, but they're sure as shit gonna hear this and maybe they'll wake the fuck up.",

        "We recently watched the documentary \"Cluck You!\", which showed us the fucked manner in which the American poultry industry handles business. As lovers of all animals, we were shocked and disgusted at the acts carried out by the \"top-dogs\" of the industry. No one's more guilty than the biggest name in the game\u2013 Duepur. They pack these poor creatures into warehouses, living beak to beak in their own filth. Disease, disfigurement, accelerated growth\u2013 the conditions these chickens live through are something we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies. We have no issues with people eating meat, but there's a better way to do it than this. There has to be. Maybe up there at headquarters, the big wigs can't hear the chickens' screams for mercy, but they're sure as shit gonna hear this. The Alarm Cluck will definitely wake them the fuck up."
