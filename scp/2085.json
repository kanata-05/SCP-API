In the case of SCP-2085-1 overcoming SCP-2085-B's containment implants, SCP-2085-B and SCP-2085-1 are to be terminated immediately.\n\n\nSCP-2085-A specimens are to be sedated and restrained before removal from containment chambers or in any situation requiring entry to the containment chamber.\n\n\nIn the event of successful removal and containment of SCP-2085-1, [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSCP-2085 is a militant anarchist organization consisting of six cybernetically-enchanced individuals (A-1 through A-5 and B) operating under the name Kuroi Usagi Shidan (\u201cBlack Rabbit Company\u201d).\n\n\nSCP-2085 has been linked, through what member testimony can be verified, to numerous criminal and terrorist incidents occurring between 20\u2588\u2588 and 20\u2588\u2588 throughout east Asia, southeastern Asia, Australia and Oceania, and western North America. SCP-2085\u2019s base of operations, if extant, is unknown, as are its connections to any other groups. The recovered assets of the group consist solely of equipment held upon recovery. The existence of other assets is presumed, but such caches have not been found.\n\n\nVerified operations include smuggling, theft, assault, vandalism, kidnapping, extortion, property damage, possession of fissile materials, corporate sabotage, embezzlement, identity theft, fraud, copyright infringement, piracy, possession of narcotics with intent to sell, possession transport and sale of anomalous items, and tax evasion.\n\n\nThe targets of these operations are primarily organized crime, hate groups or groups otherwise classified as Of Interest; strikes against governmental, military or police targets, while enthusiastically supported by the members of SCP-2085, appear to be much less opportunistic than their standard activities. SCP-2085\u2019s operations are typically organized to minimize the chance of civilian casualties and to maximize material and morale damage to their target.\n\n\nAll offers made by the Foundation regarding cooperative agreements have been unilaterally rejected by all members of SCP-2085. Three of six explicitly stated death was preferable to working alongside the Foundation.\n\n\nSCP-2085-A\n\n\nSCP-2085-A subjects are five adult female augmented humans, designated SCP-2085-A-1 through SCP-2085-A-5. Subjects are genetic chimeras, each with an estimated 6-10 different gene donors. Subjects are fluent in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Korean, Russian, and English, with additional languages varying by individual. All subjects display behaviors typical of autism spectrum disorder. Subjects display an array of genetic and cybernetic enhancements, including:\n\n\n\n\nCosmetic genetic splices of \nFelis catus\n physiology, including ears, tails, and hair coloration. Tails are prehensile and capable of holding small objects.\n\n\nGrip pads on hands and feet.\n\n\nRetractable fingertip blades.\n\n\nOcular implants with thermal vision, heads-up display, and recording functionality.\n\n\nCarbon-nanoweave muscle fiber augmentation and reinforced endoskeleton\n\n\nBrain-computer interface with internal hard drive\n\n\nWireless communication suite with local tactical network\n\n\nDrug glands providing pain dampening, heightened sensory awareness, and altered pheromones.\n\n\n\n\nThese implants are uniform in design and show minimal signs of modification after installation. Some cosmetic alterations have been made more recently. See Document SCP-2085-A-EXP for further information.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B\n\n\nSCP-2085-B is an adult male human bearing the following cybernetic and genetic enhancements:\n\n\n\n\nAdaptation of the gastrointestinal tract for a liquid diet. Esophageal input port and waste output port are integrated into the suit.\n\n\nModifications to regulate sweat, reduce abrasion damage from extended suit usage, and aid in skin regeneration.\n\n\nRemoval of genitalia.\n\n\nReplacement of 11 missing digits on hands and feet.\n\n\nInternal drug pump, typically used for painkillers.\n\n\nContainment implants for SCP-2085-1.\n\n\n\n\nSee Document 2085-B-EXP for extended information on all known enhancements.\n\n\nThese modifications were accrued over a period of several years (the oldest stated to be installed in 20\u2588\u2588 and the most recent dating to three weeks before containment) from multiple sources (none of which have yet been disclosed), and are of significantly lower quality than those used by SCP-2085-A. Many parts of the SCP-2085-1 containment implants have been replaced or modified.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B is in generally poor health, suffering from vitamin D deficiency (now lessened due to changes in diet), acute radiation syndrome (symptoms indicate at least three doses of ~2\u00a0Gy), and heavy scarring from severe and repeated skin ulceration. SCP-2085-B is fluent in English and limited Japanese and is generally cooperative with staff. SCP-2085-B wears an S1035 ACES\n1\n at all times, generally accompanied by a bathrobe and red felt wizard's hat. SCP-2085-B has been permitted to retain possession of these items to encourage further cooperation.\n\n\nSCP-2085-1\n\n\nSCP-2085-1 is a fibrous mass of self-replicating carbon nanomaterials within SCP-2085-B\u2019s chest cavity, with growths protruding into the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, spinal cord, and left lung. The growth of the SCP-2085-1 and its consumption of SCP-2085-B\u2019s body tissues has been impeded through the addition of various containment implants used to sever communication between growth sections and control nodes and counter the replication process.\n\n\nSCP-2085-1\u2019s rate of replication without the influence of these containment implants is unknown: SCP-2085-1\u2019s periods of activity occur, on average, once every three months. The process lasts for up to fifteen minutes and causes SCP-2085-B intense pain. SCP-2085-B has claimed to communicate with SCP-2085-1 during these activity periods, though this claim has not been verified.\n\n\nRecovery Report\n\n\nThe Foundation initially became aware of SCP-2085 on 08/13/20\u2588\u2588, after the execution killings of four members of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in [REDACTED] Texas\n2\n. Among those killed was Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who served as a federal liaison for the Special Personnel Procurement Program. State and federal law-enforcement were deployed, making initial contact with SCP-2085 at 16:47 the following day. Recovery agents were deployed after confirmation of anomaly. Containment confirmed at 0344 on 08/17/20\u2588\u2588 in [REDACTED], Wyoming and transported to Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for processing.\n\n\nAt the time of capture, total casualties caused by SCP-2085 numbered [REDACTED].\n\n\nTimeline of Motions Filed Regarding SCP-2085\n\n\n\n\n08/18/20\u2588\u2588: Internal Security Department files a motion with the Board of Project Review requesting immediate termination of the subjects on the grounds of enemy combatant status and that they not qualify for the protections of a contained anomaly, citing precedent in similar combat interactions with members of GOI-\u2588\u2588\u2588, GOI-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and GOI-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n08/25/20\u2588\u2588: Motion struck down: incomplete threat assessment of anomaly\n\n\n08/25/20\u2588\u2588: Internal Security Department files motion with Directors\u2019 Committee requesting transfer of subjects to ISD custody from Residential Research Department, citing SCP-2085 as active security threat and anti-Foundation ideological hazard.\n\n\n09/04/20\u2588\u2588: Director\u2019s Committee fails to reach 2/3 majority.

You\u2019re not the US government.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Wait, hold on \u2013 did you receive an orientation packet? It would have been a dark grey folder with a logo and \u201cNew Resident Orientation\u201d printed on the front.\n\n\nSCP-2085-A-1:\n I have not.

We\u2019re getting off topic, I think. You were about to tell me about the aim of your organization?\n\n\nSCP-2085-A-1:\n Escape. Until then, direct action towards the destruction of fascism and the dismantling of the capitalist and colonial structures that support it.

Now, before we get started with the official questions, my associates wanted me to ask why you call yourselves the Black Rabbit Company. They were expecting black cat.\n\n\nSCP-2085-A-2:\n Well there\u2019s a rabbit on the moon, not a cat.\n5\n And there was already a Black Cat Company out there when we were coming up with the name. Some French art burglars or something.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I see.\n\n\nSCP-2085-A-2:\n You\u2019re not the first person to ask, don\u2019t worry.

Could I ask you a few questions?\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Mm? Oh. Yeah. Sure.

Ask away.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n All right. First, we were wondering if you\u2019d be able to tell us about your history: your name, where you\u2019re from, basic information like that.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Uh\u2026 I\u2019m a space wizard, I come from space.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n That\u2019s not particularly helpful, sir.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n [shrugs] Call me Major Tom, if you\u2019d like.

With that out of the way, we were wondering if you could tell us about your associates. How you met, how the Company formed, and so on.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Interesting story there. I was running around trying to fix this shit, [taps chest] scraping by with implants from some pretty shady characters. One of them turned out to do custom jobs for corporate execs who wanted some muscle or rich perverts who wanted sex toys. I was at the clinic to get some new parts, and when I'm going through the installation process BOOM! Big explosion and those five come barging out guns blazing. I start booking it with my chest half open, because what else do you do? And then there\u2019s a lot of scrambling around trying not to get shot by the guy\u2019s business partners, and I sorta just end up trailing along as they flee the scene. Then we steal a boat and high-tail it out of Japan.\n\n\nAnd then everything falls together. The Company, me. We\u2019re out there on the ocean, stargazing and stuffing ourselves with instant ramen and cheap beer and for the first time in ages any of us are somewhere we want to be.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nYou better be treating them well.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We\u2019re doing everything we can.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Good.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Could you explain to us the entity currently living inside you?\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Ah. Red. There\u2019s a lot to unpack.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n We have time.\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Red is\u2026I don\u2019t know. A von-neumann probe? Some kind of god-thing cast down out of the heavens? I don\u2019t know. It was inside a meteor and I was the first person on the scene. It was, or will be, immensely powerful. Kardashev scale powerful. I\u2019m afraid that this is mostly speculation. I\u2019m working off what I get when its dreams drift into mine, or when it gets active enough to try and talk directly.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n You can communicate with it?\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n No. It\u2019s one way, for now, at least. I don\u2019t think it can hear me. It just rants, mashes everything together.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And what does it say to you?\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n Not so much words as just the\u2026feeling of it all. A lot of it I can\u2019t understand, but\u2026 all right:\n\n\nIt\u2019s a cancer. It grows, and grows, it eats and grows and gets more complex until whatever it's living in starts breaking down \u2013 but it will outlive its host. It\u2019ll keep going; more food, more complex food. It dreams of a universe that\u2019s been forced into a final orderly shape where it can devour all it is possible to consume and so glutted on the universe floats down a perfect river of entropy until there is nothing left, forever. It can do nothing but leech and wait for the end.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s locked in a race against that same river for who gets to eat more of the pie, and it\u2019s being stonewalled.\n\n\nIt \nhates\n us. Humanity. We\u2019re uneaten food going to waste and we are \nso close\n and it can\u2019t get to us. Our existence is an affront, a mar on its perfect universe.\n\n\nIt hates me most of all, I think. I keep on going, and every second I stay alive and Red stays suppressed, that\u2019s energy down the drain that it can\u2019t ever get back. I think it might be afraid that it might lose. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever met resistance before.\n\n\nIt tries to bargain with me, I think. It\u2019s not good at it \u2013 it just alternates between threatening more pain or offering some sort of perpetuation of consciousness. I don\u2019t think it cares which I choose, just that I break.\n\n\nI read a story once, where there was a little red egg that can give you exactly what you want the most. And the cost is what you love best. That\u2019s Red. Waiting, right in here [taps chest] for me to take that deal.\n\n\nIt\u2019s called my bluff, and I intend to prove it wrong.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Mmmm. One last question: why the costume?\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n This? Just a symbol. A super-hero thing. Easier to believe in than a person, most of the time. Symbols are simple, people are messy. People can let you down. The world makes it difficult for people to believe in people, so we make do with symbols.\n\n\nResearcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n And what do you want people to believe in?\n\n\nSCP-2085-B:\n What people could be. What they can do. That it doesn\u2019t have to end like this. That we can make something better. Be something better. That we can keep going after we get the shit kicked out of us.\n\n\nThat\u2019s easy to say. You take a look outside and we\u2019re all insane; just a bunch of evil, angry apes murdering each other on a little ball of dirt spinning pointlessly through nothing, doomed to a brief hiccup of existence before we extinguish ourselves. And in our brief glimmer of awareness, with all the beauty of the cosmos arrayed before us, we chose to build a meatgrinder out of our broken dreams and locked ourselves inside, content to sit in our box and sit there staring at the walls, floating down the river of entropy until we die.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting against.\n\n\n[Lengthy pause]\n\n\nI\u2019ve had six months to live for over five years now, and I don\u2019t want to meet curtain call with nothing to show for it. Every day I wake up is borrowed time that I can\u2019t pay back, and eventually it\u2019s going to just cut to black and if it\u2019s not today then it might as well be tomorrow.\n\n\nThey\u2019re setting the world on fire, out there. Gunning down kids in the street, stuffing folks with nowhere to go behind fences like they\u2019re cattle. Figuring out new ways to own the ideas in your head while the topsoil blows away and the groundwater dries up. I can\u2019t save the world on my own but I have to do \nsomething\n.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nI\u2019m fucking terrified, you know? Scared of dying, scared of living to see the future. But\u2026it\u2019s easier with them around.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nI want to watch the sun rise from orbit. Me and the girls, watching the sun come up. Then I can die. I can die a free man and maybe folks will say I was a good man, and the girls will launch my body into the sun. Send me back to stardust.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nYeah. That\u2019ll be a good way to go.\n\n\n[Pause]\n\n\nIn that moment, I will be lifted away from this wretched place and be free at last, and my soul will rejoice with all the brightness of the heavens.\n\n\nSecond star to the right.

SCP-2085-A-1: There\u2019s a door right there, all you need to do is unlock it. We\u2019ll see ourselves out. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I\u2019m sorry, but- SCP-2085-A-1: But they\u2019ll shoot you for it, won\u2019t they? Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: [Silence] SCP-2085-A-1: I thought so. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say?

        "Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Good morning. My name is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I\u2019ll be running your entry interview. Let\u2019s start with your name. SCP-2085-A-2: Milly Thompson. Wait! Shit! Used that one last time. Noi! Call me Noi. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Ah. Well, thank you miss, uh, Noi. Now, before we get started with the official questions, my associates wanted me to ask why you call yourselves the Black Rabbit Company. They were expecting black cat. SCP-2085-A-2: Well there\u2019s a rabbit on the moon, not a cat. 5 And there was already a Black Cat Company out there when we were coming up with the name. Some French art burglars or something. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I see. SCP-2085-A-2: You\u2019re not the first person to ask, don\u2019t worry. I wanted to call it the Cheesecake Gunshow Brigade and that got shot down. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Shame, I like that one. On to the real questions: What\u2019s your position within the Black Rabbit Company? SCP-2085-A-2: [Flexes arm, smiles] I use my absolute god damn enormity to beat the shit out of fascists. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Thoroughly effective, no doubt. Can you tell me anything about the Black Rabbit Company\u2019s activities prior to your stay here? SCP-2085-A-2: Well you already know about the car chase\u2026Have you talked to the Major yet? Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We have. She didn\u2019t give us much in the way of specifics. SCP-2085-A-2: Hm, okay, so\u2026we do a little bit of everything, I guess. Assassinations, heists, security, deliveries, birthday parties\u2026 Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Birthday parties? SCP-2085-A-2: It was great! Minnie-Mae went as the magician and she somehow managed to get Asuka and Rei 6 into clown suits as her assistants, I have no idea how she pulled that off. Anyway, they had just cut the cake when the skinheads showed up and the gunfight started\u2026 Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: This was a child\u2019s birthday party, correct? Am I understanding this correctly? SCP-2085-A-2: Yeah! The kids fucking loved it. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: [Long pause] I don\u2019t know how to respond to that. SCP-2085-A-2: [Laughs] You\u2019ll get used to it. I can keep going if you\u2019d like \u2013 got nothing but time to kill. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Sure. SCP-2085-A-2: Okay so, there was the time we were up in Kamchatka and breaking into this old Soviet bunker, right? Place hadn\u2019t been opened up in over thirty years and was overrun by psychics and they\u2019re just sitting on some A-grade enriched plutonium. Wizard managed to talk them into a deal and get us on the inside. The black lotus dust we were selling them was all fake, of course, but they figured it out before we could get out and so everyone starts blasting\u2026 [SCP-2085-A-2 continues in this manner for three hours and fifty-three minutes. Events described were, in order: Raid on a sealed Soviet-era bunker with presumed GRU-P connections, breakup of a sex trafficking ring in Shanghai, a spate of antipolice harassment incidents under the guise of a San Francisco pizza delivery service, a raid on a white supremacist militia in Oregon, the bombing of multiple crypto-currency farms, ransomware attacks against Silicon valley tech startups, and the declaration of SCP-2085-A-4 as Queen of Thailand.] <End log>",

Please state your name for the record. SCP-2085-A-3: Aisha Clan-Clan. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 : And your position within the Company? SCP-2085-A-3: Field medic, translator, support crew. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 :What can you tell me about your friend Wizard\u2019s condition? SCP-2085-A-3: Oh, that\u2026Wizard always says he doesn\u2019t want to make us worry about him. But we know what to do in case he has an episode. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And what do you do when that happens? SCP-2085-A-3: We get him his toolkit, and if we need to do anything else he tells us then. Most of the time he can do it himself, but sometimes he needs more help than we can do in the field. When that happens, we have to contact some extra help. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can you tell me anything about these people? SCP-2085-A-3: Uh, no. Not really. They keep to themselves. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: All right. If you could tell me anything else about his condition, please. SCP-2085-A-3: Wizard says Red talks to him, whispers all this horrible stuff to him when it\u2019s growing. That it\u2019s just going to eat away with him until there\u2019s nothing left, and that that\u2019s what going to happen to everyone eventually\u2026 it makes sense, for a cancer. I haven\u2019t heard it. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Can you tell me anything about Wizard\u2019s history? What he did before joining the Company? SCP-2085-A-3: Not really. He mentioned a while ago that he had a family, but he never brought it up again. They probably think he\u2019s dead or that he ran off or something. He doesn\u2019t really have anything left from back then, so we\u2019re his family now. A man doesn\u2019t toss his old life away if there was something worth keeping hold of. <End log>",

You give us three meals a day and a bed and a few books, and you pretend like it justifies locking us in here like animals in cages or dolls on a shelf. You learned how to be polite, how to dress up in labcoats and say please and thank you and pretend like you have souls. Who do you think you\u2019re fooling? We know who you are, you and your kin. You\u2019re all the fucking same, no matter if you say its for state or god or self-interest. You just like hurting people. You\u2019ll build an empire on corpses and call it a garden. After all we\u2019ve done, all we\u2019ve been able to survive, we\u2019re right back in the place we escaped. Just pretty women in boxes. We were going to get to space. We were going to build the ship, and we\u2019d go all the way up past the sky and look down at the world, and we would have won. We would have fucking won. We would be alive. And we could show everyone that it\u2019s okay, that they can be free too, that they can be alive. We\u2019d help them. And now\u2026 nothing. You\u2019ve won, okay? You\u2019ve fucking won.

Yeah. Sure. Hold on a tic. [SCP-2085-B puts on bathrobe and wizard hat, moves chair to interview window, and sits down] SCP-2085-B: There we go. Ask away. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: All right. First, we were wondering if you\u2019d be able to tell us about your history: your name, where you\u2019re from, basic information like that. SCP-2085-B: Uh\u2026 I\u2019m a space wizard, I come from space. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That\u2019s not particularly helpful, sir. SCP-2085-B: [shrugs] Call me Major Tom, if you\u2019d like. It really isn\u2019t important. I\u2019m just a guy with a hat. If Joe Everyman and John Doe were a gay couple, I would be the nameless neighbor. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I see. With that out of the way, we were wondering if you could tell us about your associates. How you met, how the Company formed, and so on. SCP-2085-B: Interesting story there. I was running around trying to fix this shit, [taps chest] scraping by with implants from some pretty shady characters. One of them turned out to do custom jobs for corporate execs who wanted some muscle or rich perverts who wanted sex toys. I was at the clinic to get some new parts, and when I'm going through the installation process BOOM! Big explosion and those five come barging out guns blazing. I start booking it with my chest half open, because what else do you do? And then there\u2019s a lot of scrambling around trying not to get shot by the guy\u2019s business partners, and I sorta just end up trailing along as they flee the scene. Then we steal a boat and high-tail it out of Japan. And then everything falls together. The Company, me. We\u2019re out there on the ocean, stargazing and stuffing ourselves with instant ramen and cheap beer and for the first time in ages any of us are somewhere we want to be. [Pause] You better be treating them well. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We\u2019re doing everything we can. SCP-2085-B: Good. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Could you explain to us the entity currently living inside you? SCP-2085-B: Ah. Red. There\u2019s a lot to unpack. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We have time. SCP-2085-B: Red is\u2026I don\u2019t know. A von-neumann probe? Some kind of god-thing cast down out of the heavens? I don\u2019t know. It was inside a meteor and I was the first person on the scene. It was, or will be, immensely powerful. Kardashev scale powerful. I\u2019m afraid that this is mostly speculation. I\u2019m working off what I get when its dreams drift into mine, or when it gets active enough to try and talk directly. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: You can communicate with it? SCP-2085-B: No. It\u2019s one way, for now, at least. I don\u2019t think it can hear me. It just rants, mashes everything together. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And what does it say to you? SCP-2085-B: Not so much words as just the\u2026feeling of it all. A lot of it I can\u2019t understand, but\u2026 all right: It\u2019s a cancer. It grows, and grows, it eats and grows and gets more complex until whatever it's living in starts breaking down \u2013 but it will outlive its host. It\u2019ll keep going; more food, more complex food. It dreams of a universe that\u2019s been forced into a final orderly shape where it can devour all it is possible to consume and so glutted on the universe floats down a perfect river of entropy until there is nothing left, forever. It can do nothing but leech and wait for the end. But it\u2019s locked in a race against that same river for who gets to eat more of the pie, and it\u2019s being stonewalled. It hates us. Humanity. We\u2019re uneaten food going to waste and we are so close and it can\u2019t get to us. Our existence is an affront, a mar on its perfect universe. It hates me most of all, I think. I keep on going, and every second I stay alive and Red stays suppressed, that\u2019s energy down the drain that it can\u2019t ever get back. I think it might be afraid that it might lose. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever met resistance before. It tries to bargain with me, I think. It\u2019s not good at it \u2013 it just alternates between threatening more pain or offering some sort of perpetuation of consciousness. I don\u2019t think it cares which I choose, just that I break. I read a story once, where there was a little red egg that can give you exactly what you want the most. And the cost is what you love best. That\u2019s Red. Waiting, right in here [taps chest] for me to take that deal. It\u2019s called my bluff, and I intend to prove it wrong. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Mmmm. One last question: why the costume? SCP-2085-B: This? Just a symbol. A super-hero thing. Easier to believe in than a person, most of the time. Symbols are simple, people are messy. People can let you down. The world makes it difficult for people to believe in people, so we make do with symbols. Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: And what do you want people to believe in? SCP-2085-B: What people could be. What they can do. That it doesn\u2019t have to end like this. That we can make something better. Be something better. That we can keep going after we get the shit kicked out of us. That\u2019s easy to say. You take a look outside and we\u2019re all insane; just a bunch of evil, angry apes murdering each other on a little ball of dirt spinning pointlessly through nothing, doomed to a brief hiccup of existence before we extinguish ourselves. And in our brief glimmer of awareness, with all the beauty of the cosmos arrayed before us, we chose to build a meatgrinder out of our broken dreams and locked ourselves inside, content to sit in our box and sit there staring at the walls, floating down the river of entropy until we die. That\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting against. [Lengthy pause] I\u2019ve had six months to live for over five years now, and I don\u2019t want to meet curtain call with nothing to show for it. Every day I wake up is borrowed time that I can\u2019t pay back, and eventually it\u2019s going to just cut to black and if it\u2019s not today then it might as well be tomorrow. They\u2019re setting the world on fire, out there. Gunning down kids in the street, stuffing folks with nowhere to go behind fences like they\u2019re cattle. Figuring out new ways to own the ideas in your head while the topsoil blows away and the groundwater dries up. I can\u2019t save the world on my own but I have to do something . [Pause] I\u2019m fucking terrified, you know? Scared of dying, scared of living to see the future. But\u2026it\u2019s easier with them around. [Pause] I want to watch the sun rise from orbit. Me and the girls, watching the sun come up. Then I can die. I can die a free man and maybe folks will say I was a good man, and the girls will launch my body into the sun. Send me back to stardust. [Pause] Yeah. That\u2019ll be a good way to go. [Pause] In that moment, I will be lifted away from this wretched place and be free at last, and my soul will rejoice with all the brightness of the heavens. Second star to the right. Straight on till morning. You know how it goes. <End log>",
