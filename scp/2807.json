SCP-2807 refers to a previously abandoned Foundation storage facility, estimated to be more than 200 years old, and most likely abandoned after the [REDACTED] event. Despite several breach attempts, the storage facilities inside remained intact. \nSCP-1215\n and several archives were recovered.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYou dragged us from our homes, our children, and our wives, with no cause. To be used in your sick experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2807's effects were initially noted in the D-Class recovery wing - analysis of medical statistics across Foundation sites indicated that grievously injured (4 - 6 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale) D-class recovered \u2588\u2588\u2588% more often than projected, even when controlling other factors. Several D-class were also recovered from injuries previously thought to be lethal.

It is believed that SCP-2807 cannot access information with a clearance above Level 3.\n\n\nContainment is focused on controlling access to SCP-2807. Due to its useful effects, Site-04 has been converted to a medical site.\n [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED] \nSCP-2807 requires at least 300 D-class in varying states of injury at all times. Source of injury must come from testing or accident - the anomaly can differentiate between injuries deliberately caused and those from testing.\n\n\nSite-04 is to be cordoned off for a 3\u00a0km radius and have limited access as a sacred area and archaeological dig. Site-04 encompasses SCP-2807. [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED]\n\n\nAccess to SCP-2807 is limited to D-class personnel. \nWings -7 through 14, -19, and -21 have been walled off. Access to these wings is strictly prohibited, except in the case of an 2807-Golf event.\n D-class personnel with medical training should permanently staff the facility. In the event Foundation personnel lacking these qualifiers enter SCP-2807, they should be immediately stripped of their clearance and reclassified as D-class. [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED]\n\n\nIn the event that D-class at SCP-2807 drop below the required amount trigger an 2807-Golf event, one member with ranking of at least Site Director\n1\n must enter Wing -19, and one D-class elevated to their position.\n\n\nOne copy of this document must remain in a server at Site-04 at all times, and re-examined weekly for any possible changes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2807 is located in Eastern Turkey, near the ancient ruined city of Ani.\n\n\nSCP-2807 refers to Site-04 in its entirety except for the control center, which exists separately from the rest of site.\n \nSCP-2807 refers to the malicious entity that has manifested in Site-04, as a result of previous activities undertaken by the Foundation prior to [DATA EXPUNGED]. This entity possesses knowledge of Foundation security practices and can directly influence D-class. D-class have been supplied with network usernames and passwords, door passcodes, Foundation identity cards and [REDACTED], believed to be a result of effects of SCP-2807. The anomaly also has the ability to alter Foundation documents, but does not appear to have access to documents cleared above Level 3. The anomaly appears to be mollified by the presence of D-class, especially injured D-class.\n\n\nSite-04 refers to a previously abandoned Foundation storage\n, testing and D-class processing\n facility, estimated to be more than 200 years old, and most likely abandoned after the [REDACTED] event. Despite several breach \nand destruction\n attempts, the storage facilities inside remained intact. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and several archives were recovered. [UNAUTHORIZED EDITS REMOVED]\n\n\nArchaeological analysis and documentation acquired prior to the sealing of several of Site-04's wings has revealed the function and history of Site-04 prior to its reactivation. See Document 2807-2 - Historical Information.\n\n\nSCP-2807's effects were initially noted in the D-Class recovery wing - analysis of medical statistics across Foundation sites indicated that grievously injured (4 - 6 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale) D-class recovered \u2588\u2588\u2588% more often than projected, even when controlling other factors.

In Andersonville - as hellish as it was - the problems were ones of logistics. The rebels were out of food, so we had nothing to eat. Our suffering was caused by lack of supply and incompetence, not malice. Here - the facilities are clean, there's plenty to eat - but they choose not to utilize that to our benefit. The guards and staff are well-fed, but we get a small piece of bread, and small amount of water per day. Prisoners that get sick are only treated if they feel it necessary. There are eight of us per room in rooms hardly fit for two. We fall asleep every night and wake every morning to the sound of human suffering. There are no natural light sources - we can hardly tell from one day to the next. They'll take ten prisoners, kill two, and grind them into paste. They'll take the other eight and torture and beat them into submission. Sometimes, people go into these torture sessions - and come out different. Like they forgot who they were, what this is, and what kind of hell they're living in. They're usually pretty quickly moved away from the site too. This place was made to break us. For what purpose, I do not know.\n\n\nAnyone that tries to stand up to them is swiftly whisked away, never to be seen again. I don't know what's going on here, or why, and I don't think I'm going to get the opportunity to do so anytime soon. I'll try to keep adding more to this note - but I may be killed or changed without warning. If you find this note - please, stop whoever is doing this.
