For this purpose, a damage-resistant and noise dampening visage of construction work is maintained around SCP-4651, while neighbouring buildings have been purchased by Foundation front organisations.\n\n\nHidden recording devices are to monitor the structure on a 24-hour basis. In the event of an SCP-4651-2 event escalating beyond the containment measures currently in place, MTF-Sierra-7 (\u201cThunderous Roses\u201d) is to be dispatched from the nearby Site-28 and all hostiles within the structure neutralised. All witnesses are to be amnesticized, and disinformation protocols enacted in local media platforms.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4651 is a three-storey office complex located in the SoHo neighbourhood of New York, currently occupied by an insurance firm known as \u201cSchmitt\u2019s Life Insurance Ltd\u201d. The firm sells valid, non-anomalous life insurance plans that function in ways that would be expected from an insurance provider.\n\n\nSCP-4651\u2019s anomalous effects concern the firm\u2019s workforce, who spontaneously appear within the structure from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM EST. Workers will not leave SCP-4651 voluntarily and will vanish if forcible extraction is attempted, re-emerging the next day. Furthermore, workers have been proven unable to recall details of a life beyond their employment, instead placing extreme value on their standing within the company.\n\n\nSCP-4651\u2019s workforce appears to possess a rudimentary class system, with staff entering a \u201cruling class\u201d upon promotion to the role of \u201cSenior Insurance Associate\u201d or higher. Members of this class receive higher quality food within SCP-4651\u2019s employee cafeteria, possess offices with more comfortable furnishings and are exempt from all known disciplinary and behavioural policies. In contrast, those in menial positions are near universally mistreated by the higher classes, receiving less food and fewer breaks.\n\n\nEvery 10-16 weeks, an SCP-4651-1 (\u201cpromotion\u201d) event will occur. Workers will become aware of an opportunity for advancement within the company, before entering a period of hyperactivity with the goal of securing the opportunity in question. Work will become unproductive, with employees demonstrating a marked decrease in professionalism and morality. These behavioural changes will gradually increase in severity, with psychopathic and destructive behaviour typically becoming common within 4-6 days. SCP-4651 will then descend into complete violence until the promotion is \u201cawarded\u201d, followed by the reversal of all casualties and damage incurred via unknown means. During these events, propaganda and smear campaigns are common, along with factions forming to support the promotion of particular candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior shot of the structure, distorted by the sudden detonation of plastic explosives by an employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolent conflicts within SCP-4651 are typically fuelled by weapon donations from senior staff, who have been documented emerging from offices with large stockpiles of munitions. When awarding promotions, senior staff typically consider damage and loss of life caused in most cases.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-4651 entered Foundation custody on 12/06/17. Owing to an in-progress SCP-4651-1 event, several street-level windows were shattered by stray bullets, injuring a number of external bystanders. Dispatched police officers incurred significant casualties upon attempting to enter, triggering a standoff that was quickly discovered by NYPD-embedded Foundation assets. Agents then utilised aerosolised amnestics to clear all roads providing access, which coupled with a pretence of burst water mains, allowed for establishment of a perimeter.\n\n\n14 hours following perimeter establishment, several explosions were detected within the structure, prompting the issue of an MTF-Sierra-7 scramble order, with the objectives of neutralising combatants and gathering intel on SCP-4651. A transcript of this mission is found below.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a04651-A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Addendum\u00a04651-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Sierra-7 exits their transport vehicle and proceeds toward the main entrance of SCP-4651. There are no apparent signs of life in or around the building.\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Member Taylor:\n Area appears deserted.\n\n\n\n\nExpedition Command\n: Our intel indicates hostiles still remain inside the building. Your job is to clean up the rest, no exceptions.\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Commander Henderson:\n Understood. Squad, let\u2019s do this by the books.\n\n\n\n\nSierra-7 proceeds to the entrance, with Henderson entering SCP-4651\u2019s foyer first. Rubble and ash cover a large portion of the area, while a large hole can be seen in the ceiling through Henderson\u2019s helmet cam. Henderson shines his flashlight through the hole to the upper floors, which lack power. The rest of MTF-Sierra-7 follow.\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Member Yeung\n: Jesus.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral bodies are sprawled behind SCP-46516\u2019s reception desk, with hands zip-tied behind their backs. Gunshot wounds indicate execution via shots to the head. Text messily scrawled on the wall behind the bodies reads: \u201cWHO\u2019S THE BIG SHOT NOW??\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYeung:\n What the hell happened here?\n\n\n\n\nHenderson:\n Keep it together Corporal Yeung. Let the lab boys figure it out. As for us\u2026 we\u2019ll cover the building one floor at a time. You and Davidson can take this floor. Williams and Perez, you get the second. Me and Taylor will take the third. Rendezvous back here at 1700 hours.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n And keep your eyes open.\n\n\n\n\nHenderson nods. Sierra-7 then splits up into its assigned teams. Henderson and Taylor proceed up a nearby stairwell to the 3rd floor, with several bodies in advanced stages of decomposition found throughout. Henderson and Taylor reach the third floor, with muffled voices audible from beyond the doorway. The door itself appears to have been previously breached by explosives. Taylor pauses, before deploying her camera mount, extending it through the open doorway and scanning the workspace.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n [Whispering] Four of them, armed. Sitting ducks.\n\n\n\n\nThe feed reveals four dishevelled SCP-4651 workers hunched around a makeshift fire, using various papers scattered throughout the area as fuel. None have weapons within reaching distance. Henderson picks up several leaflets and brochures that have blown into the stairwell, bagging them for later examination. Taylor\u2019s microphone is able to capture the conversation of the SCP-4651 workers:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4651 Instance-1:\n \u2026bastard finally got what was coming to him. Good riddance.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4651 Instance-2:\n It\u2019s a damn shame too, Frank. Remember that bake sale in \u201917? Made the best damn lemon cakes I\u2019ve ever tasted.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4651 Instance-1:\n Well now he can feed them to his traitor buddies all day long in hell.\n\n\n\n\nExpedition Command:\n That\u2019s excellent. Hold steady for a little while longer, we\u2019d like to observe their behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor rotates the camera head in various directions, capturing focal points around the space. More bodies are scattered throughout, with an observation window to the 2nd floor partly shattered and covered with viscera. Below, MTF-Members Williams and Perez approach several deceased SCP-4651 employees. The silence is broken by several audible gunshots from the ground floor. All 2nd floor employees immediately become alert.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4651 Instance-3:\n What was that? Ashley\u2019s boys?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4651 Instance-2:\n Can\u2019t be. We put them to the torch last week, remember?\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4651 Instance-3:\n Well whoever they are, let\u2019s go sell them some insurance. Something tells me they\u2019re gonna need it.\n\n\n\n\nThe figures stand, moving to pick up their weapons.\n\n\n\n\nHenderson:\n [Whispering] Now.\n\n\n\n\nHenderson and Taylor proceed around the corner and terminate two hostiles each. No firefight takes place. The two then advance and begin searching the bodies.\n\n\n\n\nHenderson:\n Four hostiles down.\n\n\n\n\nExpedition Command:\n Excellent work, now proceed to the-\n\n\n\n\nCommand is interrupted by disembodied applause coming from the opposite end of the room. A middle-aged Caucasian male enters the workspace through an adjacent office door. The door itself appears pristine, with no sign of blast damage contrary to its surroundings.\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified Male:\n Excellent work \nindeed\n. Fast, clean\u2026 and without any fuss. You could do well here.\n\n\n\n\nExpedition Command:\n Hold your fire Commander. We\u2019d like to hear what he has to say.\n\n\n\n\nHenderson:\n Identify yourself!\n\n\n\n\nThe figure\u2019s facial expression changes from impressed to incredulous.\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified Male:\n Really?\n\n\n\n\nThe figure gestures to his lanyard, which reads \u201cKeith Robinson, Floor Manager\u201d\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified Male:\n Don\u2019t worry about it. You can just call me Keith.\n\n\n\n\nHenderson:\n And what exactly is it you do here, Keith?\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n Are you responsible for the bodies?\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n What\u2026 those? Oh no, I\u2019m more of a\u2026 helping hand, you could say. I keep things running smoothly. Make sure everyone gets their fair shot.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n And you do that\u2026 how exactly?\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n [Sighing] Look, I\u2019m not gonna bore you with the ins and outs of everything we do here. It\u2019s our principles that matter. Take you, for example, you are? [Keith gestures towards Henderson].\n\n\n\n\nHenderson:\n The leader of this Task Force. Henderson.\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n Right, Henderson. I\u2019ve seen your type before. You\u2019ve got that jaded look in your eye. You\u2019re on the clock here, but I\u2019ll bet this is just grunt work, isn\u2019t it? Orders sent out by uninterested bosses looking to fill a checklist. Never pushing you or giving you something to \nreally\n sink your teeth into.\n\n\n\n\nKeith pauses momentarily, before casually reaching into his suit pocket. Taylor and Henderson react immediately.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n Don\u2019t move! Keep your hands where we can see them!\n\n\n\n\nKeith\u2019s expression once again becomes incredulous.\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n Easy, just a cigarette.\n\n\n\n\nHe removes the packet and lights one, though the smoke is barely visible amidst the smoke already trickling through the structure.\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n Where was I? Right. We don\u2019t do that same old bullcrap here. Everyone has a chance to make something of themselves. If you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019ll rise up quickly, and what better way to get there than to turn up the heat and smoke out the competition? Isn\u2019t that the American Dream after all? You can stand still and get left behind in the dust, or grab opportunity by the balls and move up one way or another. Isn\u2019t that chance worth something?\n\n\n\n\nTaylor and Henderson pause, glancing at each other briefly before turning back to Keith, ignoring the question.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n Duly noted. Can you explain the origins of the weaponry used by the employees here?\n\n\n\n\nKeith chuckles.\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n Well, and this is something you ought to know well, any decent worker needs the right tools! In fact, I suppose you could say-\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified Voice:\n YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME? Acting all high and mighty, giving Ben that shot? Well it\u2019s time to return the favour!\n\n\n\n\nA volley of gunshots sound, although the bullets appear to directly phase through Keith\u2019s body, hitting the wall behind him. Two armed SCP-4651 employees then emerge from the stairwell behind Henderson and Taylor. The two MTF-members immediately turn to engage, although they are unable to react before further gunshots sound.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n The hell?\n\n\n\n\nSlow motion playback indicates both employees were terminated before Taylor and Henderson were able to aim and fire. The bodies of the employees fall to the ground, each with a neat hole in the centre of the forehead.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor, visibly shocked, turns back to Keith.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n How did you\u2026?\n\n\n\n\nKeith is now armed with a comically long-barrelled, western-style revolver. Video analysis shows no indication of the firearm being on his person prior to being produced, which occurred off-camera.\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n Call it a trick of the trade.\n\n\n\n\nKeith smiles at Taylor.\n\n\n\n\nKeith:\n Let me know if you need anything else. We\u2019re always looking to expand!\n\n\n\n\nKeith de-materialises from the area.\n\n\n\n\nTaylor:\n Asshole. Felt like basic training all over again.\n\n\n\n\nMTF-Sierra-7 then proceeds through the remainder of the structure, eliminating 42 hostiles before returning to the foyer. No major injuries were incurred by any members of Sierra-7, though MTF member Taylor reported a feeling of being \u201cwatched\u201d during her remaining time in the structure. Following the mission and SCP-4651\u2019s return to normal operations, proper SCP classification was given and full containment procedures established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum\u00a04651-B\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Addendum\u00a04651-B\n\n\n\n\n\nScan of a document retrieved from SCP-4651 by MTF-Sierra-7.
