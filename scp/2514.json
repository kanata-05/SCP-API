Maintenance of the stable and subject itself is to be carried out by automated systems whenever possible, as to minimize human contact. Any unautomated care is to be fulfilled by a rotating staff of D-Class trained in equestrian care. Any personnel attending to SCP-2514 must be equipped with fire-retardant clothing and hearing protection of 40 NRR. SCP-2514's diet must consist entirely of pure sugar. Research into alternative means of sustenance is pending approval from the site director.\n\n\nAny D-Class personnel caught consuming SCP-2514's feces are to be reprimanded.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2514 is a member of \nEquus ferus caballus\n with a weight of 178\u00a0kg and a height of 116\u00a0cm at the withers. The subject's anomalous effects manifest at periodic intervals, henceforth referred to activation-events. These activation-events happen every 2 to 7 hours, for 3 to 15 minutes. During this period, SCP-2514 begins expelling lit pyrotechnic stars while emitting an altered version of the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" at a high volume (90 to 110\u00a0dB). This version of the song is addressed to one \"Jeremy Huertes\"\n1\n. Approximately 10% of the time, SCP-2514 will fail to enter this state properly. When this happens, its pyrotechnics will fail to ignite and its music will be replaced with a high pitched static noise.\n\n\nSCP-2514's rendition of \"Happy Birthday to You\" has cognitohazardous effects. Subjects who listen to the song in its entirety will experience intrusive thoughts of joyful memories, as well as a strong compulsion to smile. Despite this, subjects report extreme discomfort. These effects are absent in the static produced in failed activation-events.\n\n\nExposure to SCP-2514 during activation-events leads to the development of various medical complications, including obesity, hyperglycemia, ADHD, hirsutism, abnormal tissue growths, and [REDACTED]. These effects begin to manifest after 4 activation effects. The disease vector is currently unknown, but SCP-2514's song has been ruled out. Long term trials are currently being held to see if repeated yet infrequent exposure induces these effects.\n\n\nTesting has shown that SCP-2514 can only derive sustenance from pure sugar. Despite this, it still has all the nutritional requirements of non-anomalous horse of its size. As a result, SCP-2514 has developed various illnesses, including laminitis, colic, and equine metabolic syndrome. Testing has shown that, through anomalous means, the sugar consumed by SCP-2514 is converted into chocolate cake and lemonade, in lieu of typical waste products.\n\n\nSCP-2514 was recovered from Portland, Maine, USA, after reported sightings of \"mutant deer\" and \"strange pyrotechnics\" in the city's outskirts.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Below is the version of \"Happy birthday to You\" that plays during activation events.\n\n\n\n\nHappy notdeathday for you.\n\nHappy notdeathday for you.\n\nHappy notdeathday caribou Jeremy Huertes.\n\nHappy notdeathday for you.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum:\n On 2016/06/29, SCP-2514 began playing the traditional version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" instead of its original composition, coinciding with the song's entry into the public domain the day prior.\n\n\nAddendum:\n During a containment breach on 20\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, Agents John and Jane \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were killed in the line of duty. After the breach, their reanimated corpses were found wandering SCP-2514's stable. These entities have been tentatively given the designation of SCP-2514-1. The SCP-2514-1 were not responsive to any stimuli, and deteriorated within 24 hours. They constantly repeated the phrases \"We love you Jeremy\", \"We'll get through this together\", and \"You've been such a good boy, you deserve a trip to down to the Dr. Wondertainment Never-Ending Toystore\nTM\n for some Dr. Wondertainment Endless-Fun\nTM\n.\"\n2\n\n\nResearch into recreating SCP-2514-1 is currently ongoing.\n\n\nAddendum:\n On 20\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, the following message was found on the desk of Project-Manager-2514, Emma Lister.\n\n\n\n\nTo our esteemed collectors, the Fun-dation:\n\n\nOn behalf of her Majoysty Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Wondertainment \u2588, who is too be busy crying her Doctor Wondertainment Super-Sight Eyes\nTM\n out to make this letter all the more personal with trademark Wondertainment Sincerity\nTM\n, we both commend your Wondertainment Brand-Loyalty\nTM\n, and condemn your Wondertainment Cat-Killing-Curiosity\nTM\n.
