Contact or experimentation with SCP-1460 outside of standard medical care may only be performed with prior permission from at least two (2) senior research personnel.\n\n\nSCP-1460 is to be administered a pentobarbital/thiopental regimen daily.\n Until further notice, use of medication outside of that required for basic medical care has been suspended.\n\n\nElements of Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\") have been deployed to the areas affected by SCP-1460 and have standing authorization to administer amnestics as necessary to maintain secrecy and minimize disruption of the civilian population.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1460 is a 32-year old male Asian-American identified as [REDACTED], a former resident of the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, USA. SCP-1460 has been in a coma for the past eight (8) years, of which the last seven (7) have been in Foundation care, as a result of a traffic accident on \u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 in which a public transit bus struck and critically injured SCP-1460 while he was walking to his place of employment. SCP-1460 was transferred to a regional hospital due to a lack of appropriate trauma facilities at the local hospital, and came to the Foundation's attention following multiple discrepancies found during a routine review of hospital medical records.\n\n\nDespite SCP-1460's condition, individuals involved in his daily life have reportedly been in contact with him during the entirety of the interval in which he has been comatose and are not aware of his current condition. Although there is a complete lack of corroboration from locally available surveillance footage, friends and family have reported that SCP-1460 has lived for the last ten (10) years in a low-income apartment in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and has been employed at a local supermarket for the same duration, where work is done that is attributed to SCP-1460. Furthermore, records of bank transactions and ATM usage are periodically registered which are attributable to SCP-1460, which also do not appear on bank or ATM surveillance video, despite corroboration from bank employees regarding SCP-1460's activity.\n\n\nAddendum 1460-01:\n Excerpt from Interview 1460-03B\n\n\nDate:\n \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588\n\n\nSubject:\n Mrs. L\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Mother of SCP-1460)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Undercover)\n\n\n\n\nAgent E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Thank you for your time, Mrs. H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
