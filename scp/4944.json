Caffeinated fluid is to be brought to SCP-4944 every two days unless a test is being conducted, which must be approved by personnel with clearance level 4 or higher. Drains are to be installed in the ground of Site-876-C in case of a failure to bring caffeine. Drains are only to be blocked if a test if being conducted.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4944 is the designation given to two perspectives of the same object, SCP-4944-A, the appearance of a coffee machine, and SCP-4944-B, the actual physical body of SCP-4944. SCP-4944-B resembles a 100 meter long cargo vessel. Although the name cannot be deciphered, the architecture of the hull and stern of the ship can imply that the intended use of SCP-4944-B was to import exotic goods\n2\n from Brazil to North America. When viewed directly\n3\n, SCP-4944-A has the appearance of a standard Keurig brand coffee machine, circa 2012-2016. Although bearing the appearance of a Keurig brand coffee machine, 3-dimensional digital mapping reveals the actual shape of SCP-4944 as SCP-4944-B. Although seemingly transparent, SCP-4944-B still exists physically, creating the illusion that an invisible border exists around SCP-4944-A.\n\n\n\n\nA 3-dimensional digital map of SCP-4944's physical body outlined in red. Note that SCP-4944-A is not visible in the image.\n\n\n\n\nIf any form of caffeine enters within 10 meters of SCP-4944-B, the fog horns installed in SCP-4944-B will activate, and will only cease if the caffeine is laid in front of SCP-4944-B. Although the noise exceeds 100-135 decibels,\n4\n personnel who are exposed to the sound report not hearing anything out of the ordinary while listening. Unedited audio of the noise produced by SCP-4944-B follows.\n\n\nNote: 97.7% of subjects report hearing an absence of noise during the following file.\n\n\n\n\nWhen presented with any form of caffeine in a liquid state, the liquid will begin to evaporate at an accelerated speed, especially if the substance contains traces of coffee beans. If not given caffeine within ~2 days, SCP-4944-A will begin to excrete a brown, viscous fluid similar to that of syrup from its base. This process will proceed until presented with caffeine. At this time SCP-4944 will begin to absorb the fluid back into SCP-4944-A's water chamber,\n5\n even if the amount of fluid exuded from SCP-4944 is beyond the holding capacity of the chamber. The substance produced by SCP-4944 does not have any hazardous effects, but is extremely viscid. The fluid has high levels of glucose and gelatin, causing the fluid to be highly sweet when tasted.\n\n\nOnce SCP-4944 has ingested caffeinated fluid, SCP-4944 will again blow its built in fog horn,\n6\n which when viewed in a virtual oscilloscope\n7\n, variations of \"I'm done,\" \"coffe [sic],\" or \"More pls [sic]\" are seen. SCP-4944 also uses an abundance of emoticons\n8\n using the standard \"qwerty\" keyboard. If asked a question, SCP-4944 will comply and exude a noise that when processed, will show words that vaguely answer the questions asked. This implies that SCP-4944 has some level of sapience.\n\n\nAn interview was scheduled with SCP-4944.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nAnswer seen through oscilloscope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What are you?\"\n\n\n\"Don't care, need bean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why do you enjoy caffeine?\"\n\n\n\"I have the addiction to coffe :(\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is the fluid you excrete when not supplied with caffeine?\"\n\n\n\"Coffe. drinky drinky.\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What were you used for?\"\n\n\n\"COFFE\" [sic]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why do you bear the appearance of a coffee machine?\"\n\n\n\"Practicing impression.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several more questions, it has been determined that SCP-4944 was once a cargo ship used for importing coffee beans from Brazil to North America. SCP-4944 claims to have an addiction to caffeine and coffee, likely from the abundance of coffee bean and other exotic goods shipments made with SCP-4944-B. For more information on SCP-4944's sapience, see Document-944G.\n\n\nSeveral tests have been conducted on SCP-4944 for further research into what SCP-4944 consumes and the limits of such.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiments\u00a0491-8\n\n\n\n\nCredentials\u00a0Accepted.\n\n\n\n\nBase\n\n\n\n\n[Experiment-#]\n\n\nRequest:\n [Request]\n\n\nStatus:\n [Approved/denied]\n\n\nResults:\n [Results]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment-491\n\n\nRequest:\n Black coffee.\n\n\nStatus:\n Approved.\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-4944 \"drinks\" the coffee within 5 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment-493\n\n\nRequest:\n Espresso with two shots of caffeine.\n\n\nStatus:\n Approved.\n\n\nResults:\n Drink is absorbed within 2 hours.
