The modified body bag containing SCP-2934 is to be placed within a steel chest measuring at least 2\u00a0m x 1\u00a0m in footprint, 1\u00a0m in height and 10\u00a0cm in wall thickness.\n\n\nAll surfaces of the containment chamber are to be completely coated with a layer of steel 25\u00a0cm thick. The containment chamber is to be large enough to accommodate sleeping arrangements for ten test subjects.\n\n\nOutside of testing, the modified bottom hoop of the SCP-2934-1 dreamcatcher is to remain unhooked from the top hoop and stored separately.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2934 is the preserved remains of an unidentified woman approximately eighteen years old at the time of death. SCP-2934 has Caucasian skin tone, a clean-shaven scalp, and would have measured 160 \u2013 163\u00a0cm in height before physical modification.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-2934\u00a0displays\u00a0a\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0injuries\u00a0and\u00a0alterations.\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0SCP-2934\u00a0displays\u00a0a\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0injuries\u00a0and\u00a0alterations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2934\u2019s feet and hands have been crudely excised at the ankles and wrists. Wound margins are ragged with extensive bruising and limited granulation tissue, indicating that this action was performed with a blunt hacking instrument several days before death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA dreamcatcher, designated SCP-2934-1, is fixed to SCP-2934\u2019s face with surgical staples. The dreamcatcher\n1\n is composed of a wooden hoop 5\u00a0cm in diameter that hangs below a second wooden hoop 16\u00a0cm in diameter. The top hoop is stapled between SCP-2934's eyebrows, and almost entirely covers the face. Both hoops are decorated with dangling black strings, white beads, and white down feathers from an unknown bird species. The centre of the top hoop is filled with a webbing design made with black thread. The centre of the bottom hoop does not feature the expected webbing design: instead, the space is occupied by a white two-piece LEGO sculpture\n2\n resembling a satellite dish antenna, tied to the hoop with black thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\u00a0cm of a grey USB cable emerges from a 2\u00a0cm-long, well-healed incision at the centre of SCP-2934\u2019s forehead. The exposed part of the cable ends in a Type A connector plugged into a Raspberry Pi Model 1\u00a0A. Twelve red wires 15\u00a0cm in length run from the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to a free-standing LCD plate which, despite lacking an obvious power source, is constantly powered and displays the message \u201c22\u00a004\u00a02011 LIFE 0 TRANSMIT READY\u201d. In X-ray images, the part of the USB cable concealed in SCP-2934\u2019s head appears to pass through the frontal bone and trace the mesocortical pathway of the brain, terminating in an unattached mini-USB plug. The assembly of LCD plate, Raspberry Pi and USB cable is collectively designated SCP-2934-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inside of SCP-2934\u2019s mouth held four objects at the time of discovery: three small, roughly torn scraps of yellow paper with the words \u201cKOMPETENC\u00cb\u201d, \"BESIM\" and \u201cAUTORITET\u201d\n3\n individually handwritten with pencil on each piece, and a folded, low-resolution image of a middle-aged man's face printed onto white A4 paper. The man pictured is presumed to be Ndrec Gega. (See below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2934 has been anomalously preserved by an unknown method. No chemicals commonly used for tissue preservation have been observed in sample analysis. Aside from skin pallor, SCP-2934 displays no signs of having been dead for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2934 produces an anomalous effect, designated SCP-2934-A, that acts on all individuals within a radius of 0.7 kilometres. Humans entering any stage of sleep within the area of effect will invariably experience one or more vivid dreams centred around a specific male character.\n\n\nUpon waking, affected individuals will always attribute the name \u201cNdrec Gega\u201d to this character, and their description of its appearance will match the following details: approximately fifty years old; 180 \u2013 200\u00a0cm tall; a receded hairline; grey-white hair; thick, dark eyebrows; a broad face and physique; a broad, high nose; Caucasian, with a relatively tanned, flushed skin tone; and wearing some form of suit and tie. When shown the printed image found in SCP-2934\u2019s mouth, all affected individuals will agree that the man depicted is the Ndrec Gega character from their dreams.\n\n\nThe narrative of their dreams will always feature the Ndrec Gega character acting as a capable authority figure who establishes a close personal connection to the dreaming individual. Examples of these dreams are given below.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-2934-A\u00a0dream\u00a0narrative\u00a0summaries\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0SCP-2934-A\u00a0dream\u00a0narrative\u00a0summaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nDream Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Burton\n\n\nAgent Burton is unemployed and living in his parents\u2019 house. While Agent Burton is walking through his childhood primary school, Ndrec Gega, the new headmaster, offers him a job as his personal assistant. Agent Burton works for Ndrec Gega from a desk in his third-year classroom, and feels great satisfaction in fielding his calls and organising his schedule. Ndrec Gega asks Agent Burton for advice on his haircut three times, which makes Agent Burton feel trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-163758\n\n\nD-163758 is first mate on a cruise ship travelling to Paris through the sky. Ndrec Gega is the ship's captain, and leaves D-163758 in charge of steering on three occasions. He tells D-163758 that he is very happy with her steering when he returns. The ship hits a European robin and almost crashes, but Ndrec Gega manages to prevent this through great skill and effort. When they land in Paris, Ndrec Gega is awarded an Oscar trophy. He removes the trophy\u2019s head and gives it to D-163758 as a gift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-767449\n\n\nD-767449 works on the assembly line of a shampoo factory, adding orange juice from a hose to all the shampoo bottles that pass her. Ndrec Gega is the factory supervisor. He hugs D-767449 and tells her \u201cwell done\u201d every time he walks by. Ndrec Gega finds that the productivity of the factory\u2019s machines is trebled if he sings \nHappy Birthday\n to them. He is interviewed live on national television about this discovery, and tells the interviewer and television audience that he could not have done it without D-767449\u2019s help. D-767449 is elected President of the United States as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals experiencing SCP-2934-A for the first time will report genuine \"gut feelings\" of warmth and trust for the dream character when waking, which appear to persist indefinitely. If asked how they would feel if a real-world \"Ndrec Gega\" were placed in a position of authority over them, such as their workplace manager or political representative, subjects uniformly respond in a highly positive manner.\n4\n\n\nIf SCP-2934-A dreams are experienced multiple times, however, affected individuals will quickly feel confused and uneasy about the character\u2019s continual reappearance. Almost all subjects who experience the dreams more than five times will report a level of fear and annoyance. Long-term exposure occasionally results in such an extreme negative response that some subjects have refused to sleep for extended periods to avoid seeing the entity.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2934-2 LCD screen message\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough no electromagnetic transmissions have been detected from SCP-2934 or any of its components, containing the anomaly using standard radio frequency shielding techniques appears to prevent the SCP-2934-A dream effect from acting on individuals in range. Additionally, removing the modified bottom hoop of the dreamcatcher containing the LEGO satellite dish sculpture appears to prevent SCP-2934-A entirely. Investigation into SCP-2934's effects by members of \nMTF Omicron Rho\n is pending.\n\n\nAddendum:\n A real-world individual named Ndrec Gega matching the appearance of the SCP-2934 dream character and printed image has been found. Ndrec Gega was the Democratic Party for Albania\u2019s candidate for the 2011-05-08 mayoral election of Dor\u00ebz, a town of 9,000 people in the Arr\u00ebz e Madhe municipality of northern Albania.\n\n\nLocals interviewed report a period of twelve days, lasting from the night of 2011-04-25 to the night of 2011-05-06, in which almost all the population of the Dor\u00ebz urban area experienced sleep characteristic of SCP-2934-A. Ndrec Gega lost the mayoral election three days later by a historically large margin, largely due to widespread distress about his repeated appearance in most of the electorate\u2019s dreams.\n\n\nThe real-world Ndrec Gega suffered a fatal car accident on the A1 motorway the day after the election, 2011-05-09. His car was observed to drive erratically at 180km/h before veering off the side of the road and colliding with a tree. Notably, the coroner\u2019s report remarks that both hands and both feet were traumatically amputated in the collision.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The appearance of the dreamcatcher, aside from the modified bottom hoop, is identical to a dreamcatcher listed on eBay by a Chinese-based seller with the username \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n2\n. Made using standard Parts 4285b and 3957a.\n\n\n3\n. Approximately translated from Albanian as \u201ccompetence\u201d, \"trust\" and \u201cauthority\u201d.\n\n\n4\n. This emotional response does not appear to be anomalous in itself: subjects will often make unprompted remarks that basing a conscious perception on a dream is illogical, and will be convinced by falsified documentation about a real-world Ndrec Gega of highly objectionable character.\n\n\n5\n. Maximum period of wakefulness observed is four days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2933\n | SCP-2934 | \nSCP-2935\n \u00bb",
