This alert is to be passed to all partner organizations and to the Global Occult Coalition through normal emergency channels as well as to the Chaos Insurgency through backdoor emergency channels.\n\n\nAll site directors and containment teams for the Keter class anomalies included in 99-Tripurantaka are to unseal and carry out their orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCover identities for the four CRUCIFORM SNARE satellites have been established and are maintained by \nMobile Task Force Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\")\n. The Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) has been co-opted to report any neutrino activity resembling Incident 2631-1987A. After an alert of this system, sociological observers with Mobile Task Force Psi-10 (\"Maslow's Motivators\") are to be on watch for any subsequent increase in unexplained cognitive phenomena.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2631 is the collective designation for phenomena related to the four bodies (SCP-2631-A-1 through -A-4) surrounding the Earth at 90\u02da points in geostationary orbit.\n\n\nSCP-2631-A are artificial satellites of extraterrestrial origin. They are each featureless black spheres four meters in diameter. Each is surrounded by a field of unknown origin that bends light around the sphere and renders them invisible to electromagnetic sensors beyond 2\u00a0km. Following incident 2631-2008A, it is known that the satellites are able to open and deploy payloads from the interior into the Earth's atmosphere. They are capable of sending and receiving tight-beam microwave communications\n1\n to and from unknown entities in the Kuiper Belt. During incident 2631-1987A, the array acted as a neutrino source for unknown reasons, and simultaneously apparently induced medium-term human neurocognitive anomalies worldwide. It is also surmised that they possess extensive sensors monitoring the Earth and possibly throughout the solar system.\n\n\nSCP-2631 was first detected when a signal was intercepted by chance by the Big Ear Radio Telescope in 1977. Subsequent covert investigation by the Foundation eventually located the array in 1986 and it was physically inspected by Foundation astronauts in 1993. It is unknown how long the array had been in place prior to discovery.\n\n\nAddenda:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident-2631-1987A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident-2631-1987A\n\n\n\n\nOn February 23rd, 1987, the Kamiokande II and Baksan neutrino detectors registered the neutrino flux associated with Supernova 1987A. Three hours prior, the Mont Blanc liquid scintillator as well as the Foundation's neutrino detector at Area-179 detected a flux that was not related to SN1987A. It was determined that the flux originated with SCP-2631-A and was presumably timed to use the cover of the supernova. Immediately following this spike, incidents of \nSCP-2001\n were elevated 164% over normal, and didn't return to mean for over a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident-2631-2008A\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Incident-2631-2008A\n\n\n\n\nOn October 25th, 2008, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 partially breached containment (see the SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 casefile). Within one minute, each SCP-2631-A was observed to open and deployed 116 objects into the Earth's atmosphere. These objects were radar-reflective and approximately 10\u00a0cm across when deployed but expanded to 5m \"parachutes\" in the atmosphere. Each instance made a soft landing on the Earth's surface and then apparently self-destructed after SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 was successfully recontained. The remains of these objects consisted of ash composed of 90% carbon, 6% silicon, 2% gallium, 2% nitrogen as well as trace amounts of lithium, gold, iodine, iridium and tellurium. Assuming constant density these ash fields (average mass 2\u00a0kg) contain twice as much material as the initial landers. Under electron microscopic analysis, the ash contains complex fragments of nano- and pico-meter scale structures as well as large amounts of nanoparticulate graphene dust.\n\n\nA computer modeled reconstruction of this material has determined that it is very likely (p>0.26)\n2\n to be the remains of partially self-destructed Drexler universal assemblers\n3\n. All collected material is currently stored in the level-V self-replicator containment at Area-105, where it remains completely inert.\n\n\nAlso within a minute of the containment breach, a tight beam signal directed from SCP-2631-A-1 towards the outer solar system was detected. Nine hours, 12 minutes later an object was observed in the direction of the signal at approximately 35 AU from the Sun with a strong blue-shift and an estimated peak velocity of 0.2c. After SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 was successfully recontained, SCP-2631-A-1 sent a second signal. Five hours 16 minutes later the relativistic object changed course at approximately 18 AU from the Sun. 14 hours later the object disappeared after crossing Earth's orbit. This object's presumed vector would have resulted in a collision with the Earth\n4\n approximately 12.5 hours after the second signal if it had continued to accelerate.\n\n\n13 minutes after the second signal was detected, a third, more complex signal, significantly broader band than the previous signals (139.6-170.8 Ghz), was intercepted. This signal lasted for 540 seconds. A portion of it has successfully been decrypted with 16-Qbit quantum decryption and translated via information gained from study of [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\n\nFortunate report\n\nPerceived conditions for comprehensive immediate correction action\n\nSubject designation 6,376 condition type [untranslatable] resulting from type [untranslatable] designation 6376-4315\n\nRestructure action active.\n\nDestruct fail-safe active.\n\nPerceived corrective action by music-makers ongoing.\n\nMusic-maker action successful.
