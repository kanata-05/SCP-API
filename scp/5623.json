Those who witness the anomaly are to be administered Class B amnestics.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5623 is the first extraterrestrial spacecraft observed by the Foundation and was discovered 54 years before the first manmade spacecraft\n1\n and 57 years before the first manned spacecraft\n2\n existed. SCP-5623 has a frame in the form of an oblate spheroid with an outer chamber on the bottom side which presumably serves as a control room.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 28 August 1903, Foundation Astronomers observed SCP-5623 near the Orion Nebula in the Milky Way Galaxy through a telescope.\n\n\nSCP-5623 has not been sighted since its discovery by any telescope or spatial equipment. Other cosmic phenomena have led Foundation Astronomers to hypothesize that SCP-5623 was pulled in by the gravity of a red dwarf star and upon impact, ceased to exist alongside the star.\n\n\nThe proposal to change its object class to neutralized is still pending.\n\n\n\n\nInsert Level 4 Credentials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The first satellite, Sputnik 1 was launched on 4 October 1957.\n\n\n2\n. The first manned spaceflight took place on 12 April 1961 when Yuri Gagarin was launched as part of the Vostok 1 mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5622\n | SCP-5623 | \nSCP-5624\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5623\n\" by Sirslash47, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
