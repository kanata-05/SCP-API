Only this strong secondhand evidence, and a number of coincidences are currently known to the Foundation.\n\n\nEE-3682 has no containment protocols, and its designation as an object is maintained in such an event. This record is presented as evidence and warning in real time. Plans have been prepared as to how to prevent such a thing from happening again, and where it may happen, and what may have caused it.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Designation:\n EE-3682\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite containing evidence of EE-3682.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceding Events:\n Evidence of EE-3682 was first considered based on further investigation into urban legends in Sakha, Russia referring to hitchhikers and travelers who asked directions to a town that did not exist. The traveler would refer to the scenery around the nonexistent town. No consensus or verifiable memetic properties have been identified, but locals sometimes refer to a town named Volodin, or Volodi, located in a valley in a grove of flowers.\n\n\n\"Volodin\" may have been discovered in a region nearby matching the description. Located in the center of the valley is a dilapidated, 20 occupant church. No other signs of human occupancy in the 30 mi\u00b2 area were detectable. Located within the church were a 15cm ivory knife located on the altar, a machete, a garbage can lid, a first aid kit, a satchel, a note, 9 VHS tapes, and the skeleton of a young woman (20) who is lying on her stomach, positioned with her hand touching the altar. The altar was covered with a thin layer of congealed blood. The blood, when tested, was that of a human fetus. The blood has congealed in such a way that would suggest the object bled out there.\n\n\nOne resident of the town of Tomtor matched dental records and DNA of the corpse but otherwise showed no other signs of relation to it. The individual [REDACTED] did recall visiting the area at one time, but was not able to remember when.\n\n\nVHS tapes were secured in the altar cabinet within the church. This space was nailed in and secured with duct tape. The tapes contain images of a town that is not currently known to exist. It is not known if the tapes were compiled to arrange a narrative. Due to damage of these tapes it is not known which order these events occurred in, if these events occurred.\n\n\nItem 0:\n A note, in Russian.\n\n\n\n\nIt happened fast, I think. April 16th, 2018. It's happened everywhere. There was no warning. We don't know why this happened. If you find this, I'm sure I'll be dead. My bones grind when I walk. It is excruciating. I am lucky I had access to my father's medicine.\n\n\nThe thing couldn't change me. Or something helped me.\n\n\nIf I succeeded, you need to find Iepureanu.\n\n\n\n\nItem 1:\n Tape 1. Written in the center space is \"Ezekiel Valeriy Iepureanu, last seen in Moldova.\" The VHS is an overwritten copy of \"Homeward Bound\".\n\n\n\n\nLoad\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaid promotional advertisement for a can opener, 4 seconds.\n\n\nFootage of a woman opening a can of green beans with an electric can opener.\n\n\nVoice Over:\n \u2026and you can do all of this and more without injury\u2026\n\n\nThe audio is interrupted by an old man chuckling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootage of the internals of a beehive, 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet view of an unknown city in Russia. Footage appears to be taken from a security camera in the downtown area. It is mid-day in the summer, and the street is filled with cars, 2 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn elderly man in yellow robes sitting behind a desk. Behind him are shelves of books, to his right there is a wood stove burning. He wears a crucifix around his neck. He is transcribing something from a Bible.\n\n\nThe man does not appear to be aware that he is being filmed.\n\n\nA church hymn is playing in the background.\n\n\n10 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 2:\n Tape 2. Written on the tape is the former address of an SCP containment area in Ukraine, \nSCP-1782\n; This area contains entities similar to those found on the 3682 tapes.\n\n\n\n\nLoad\n\n\n\n\nHide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyrics set to video. Male voice chanting in Russian.\n\n\nIs it due you, my friend, or happy day?\n\n\nWhat a joyous sound around and abounds!\n\n\nIs it time for you? Oh beautiful friend!

The stalls appear to be vacant.\n\n\nSounds of metal grinding against metal are heard.\n\n\nMultiple dents appear in the doors, followed by loud metallic crashing.

No markings. An entity is visible on each of the tapes, inter-cutting itself into the footage sporadically. The object resembles a destroyed human embryo, floating in a ball of black liquid several feet from the ground. The liquid pulsates but the figure itself is motionless.

The holes turn to face the camera.\n\n\nBlack liquid is flowing around it, and people are struggling to escape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntity, roughly 9 meters tall, with hundreds of burning wings. The exact physical count of wings is indiscernible.\n\n\nWings appear to vaporize people, sending bright lights up into the sky in their place.\n\n\nAll onlookers appear to be fleeing toward the entity. Men and women make praying gestures towards it, but some seem to be ignored by the entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 6:\n Tape 6. Orange VHS tape, overwritten episode of Rocko's Modern Life. No inscriptions. The sky in later half of the tapes is filled with an array of burning circles.

[\nchuckles\n] Oh what a beautiful day it is, yes.\n\n\nThe man takes a moment to write something on parchment, seemingly forgetting about the viewer. He takes several minutes, occasionally looking outside onto a view of the city in its affected state. The man turns to the camera again, looking surprised.\n\n\nMan:\n Ah, yes. The Lord comes now for all of his faithful, and for those who at least did no harm, I hope. Hmm. But what can we say for them. I digress.\n\n\nMan:\n If you're seeing this, GOOD! If you suffer well through the tribulation, you may just be worthy to serve the Lord our God later in Heaven!\n\n\nMan:\n Ah, or you can say to hell with it. There's time for that.\n\n\nMan:\n The Lord deems fit to keep me on earth during the troubles, I assume to work these many miracles\u2026\n\n\nMan gestures to an empty shelf.\n\n\n[\nFeed Ends\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView of city square, burning figure no longer present.\n\n\nThe floating embryo intercut into the footage is floating in the middle of the town square.
