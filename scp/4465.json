Three days before the discovery of his body, his college roommate, his mother, and his family dog had all suffered identical gunshot wounds, from the roof of the mouth to the back of the head, within ten minutes of each other. Bullets matched those in SCP-4465's magazine. Arnold Dubar was 3,000 kilometers away from the nearest victim.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4465\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4465\u00a0Test\u00a0Logs\n\n\n\n\nTesting has been cancelled due to ethical concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4464\n | SCP-4465 | \nSCP-4466\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4465\n\" by DarkStuff, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
