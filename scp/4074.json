The \"nebula\" is falsely colored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4074\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n All specimens of SCP-4074-2 are to be contained in the Botanical Section on Site-31. Access to each specimen is limited to Level 3 and above personnel, and is strictly for research purposes only.\n\n\nCurrently, SCP-4074-1 is being contained in the onsite \ninfirmary\n ICU for anomalous humanoids. As soon as subject is physically and mentally fit or an interview, any qualified personnel in the immediate vicinity is authorized to begin interrogating the subject.\n\n\nUpdate:\n On 5/11/18, subject has ceased all life functions. On Dr. Evalo\u2019s approved request, the cadaver of SCP-4074-1 is to be sent to his department for his ongoing research regarding anomalous humanoids.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4074-2 is an anomalous plant, superficially and genetically similar to \nPhalaenopsis blume\n. Aside from its unusual growth rate\n1\n, the specimen\u2019s significant anomalous properties manifests when it enters its reproductive cycle.\n\n\nApproximately two weeks after its bud has developed, a glowing revolving gas, closely resembling that of a miniature nebula, will grow around the bud whose diameter and luminosity will grow exponentially, relative to the growth of the bud. Test results shows that the gas is composed of helium and hydrogen\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4074-2, five seconds after the collapse of its \"nebula\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately two weeks after its initial appearance, the gas, which usually have an average maximum diameter and luminosity of 35\u00a0cm and 280\u00a0lm, respectively, will instantaneously collapse in on itself, creating a solid six cm sized glowing orb that usually has an average temperature and luminosity of 34\u00b0C and 500\u00a0lm, respectively.\n\n\nThe orb will emit a steady output of light and heat for seven to ten days before it will begin to steadily and completely decrease both in output and activity, leaving behind a spherical pod of the same diameter. When pried open, the pod will always contain three 1.2\u00a0cm sized seeds that when planted will grow into another instance of SCP-4074-2.\n\n\nResearch in imitating the specimen\u2019s \"bioluminescence\" to create a cheap and alternative biologically-based light source is currently underway. Qualified researchers may submit an application to Dr. Leara.\n\n\nSCP-4074-1 is an emaciated Caucasian male, 1.75\u00a0m in height and 46\u00a0kg in weight. Excluding its initial discovery and the following ICU incident, no further activity or properties from or related to the subject is deemed anomalous. (Refer to addenda \"History\" and \"ICU\".)\n\n\nAddendum/History:\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nOn 6/1/18, local news about a cut-down tree bleeding blood was detected during a standard Foundation information sweep. After a sample taken by an agent confirmed that the blood was indeed human in origin, the tree was quarantined with the cover story that the blood coloration was actually a mutated tree sap that could possibly be toxic. Foundation manufactured samples were given to the local biologists to avoid suspicion. After test results showed mild toxicity, Foundation agents, disguised as international biologist and botanists were given permission to remove all traces of the tree. Upon excavation of the stump, a thicker root was discovered to be originating from a hand of an unconscious SCP-4074-1 who was contained in a cement casing 1.83 x 0.46 x 0.61\u00a0m, with his right hand protruding outside of the casing\n3\n. When subject was confirmed to be still living, SCP-4074-1, after receiving authorization from HQ, was safely extracted and discreetly rushed to the nearest Foundation site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum/ICU Incident:\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nFurther investigation of the subject revealed that all of its orifices were surgically sewn shut. The tree\n4\n grew from subject\u2019s hand which collected water, nutrients, and oxygen which it delivered to the subject as a form of sustenance\n5\n. An unknown solid object was discovered in the subject\u2019s stomach which, upon authorization, was surgically removed. Upon the object's removal, SCP-4074-1 suddenly became active and agitated, repeatedly shouting\n6\n the following words,\n\n\nGIVE IT TO ME!\n\nI NEED TO GIVE IT TO THEM!\n\nSWALLOWED IT UP TO HIDE IT!\n\nGIVE IT BACK!\n\n\nImmediately after a few minutes of struggling and screaming in its restraints, subject started to violently convulse and became unconscious. Subject has shown no signs or consciousness ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum/OOI:\n\n\n\n\nOpen\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0File\n\n\n\n\nThe object acquired from the subject's stomach was discovered to be two rolled up envelopes, encased in plastic designated as OOI (Object of Interest) 1 (external) and 2 (internal).\n\n\nOOI 1\n\n\nAs OOI 1 was more exposed to the subject's stomach fluids, it has suffered significantly more damage compared to OOI 2 which was located in the interior of the roll.\n\n\nThe content of the letter is transcribed below.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n \nDue to the damages sustained by the letter, some characters are either missing or illegible. The legible letters are transcribed as it is located on the letter.\n\n\n\n\nHello\nhidden\n swe\netie\n, I\u2019m sor\nry\n that daddy w\nasn\u2019t\nable to com\ne to y\nour party.\n\nI kn\now\n I promis\ned\n you that I will be there but work is kee\nping\n daddy \nrea\nlly busy. I\u2019m re\nally s\norry sw\neetie\n but don\u2019t worr\ny because I have a s\nurprise for you.\n\nRemembe\nr\n that t\nime\n whe\nn we w\nent to the sunflowe\nr\n farm and you wer\ne\n so disappoin\nted b\necause the \nf\nlowers didn\u2019t glow. W\nell g\nuess what?\nYou se\ne those seeds? Just plan\nt the\nm and wait for it to flower. I kno\nw how much you l\nike gardenin\ng an\nd space, so I added \na lit\ntle surprise there. Yo\nu\u2019ll just have t\no wait and see.\n\nDad\ndy is ve\nry, very sorry again swe\netie but r\nemember this, \ndaddy will a\nlways, ALWAYS love y\nou.\n\nWhy?

You deserve a better man.\n\nBut please, PLEASE, don't hide her from me. Don't make her hate me.\n\nThis world is dark and cruel but somehow, with her, it's a little bit brighter and warmer.\n\nPlease, don't take my little sunshine away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. SCP-4074-2 grows twice as fast compared to its normal species counterpart.\n\n\n2\n. Why the gases glow and are unaffected by gravity is still unknown.\n\n\n3\n. The group/organization responsible for encasing the subject is still unknown. The case itself is normal and no signs or marks that can be used to identify its source is visible.\n\n\n4\n. Despite the tree's size, its growth rings suggest that it is only four years old.\n\n\n5\n. Exactly how these process worked is still unclear.\n\n\n6\n. At the expense of lacerating the subject's lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4073\n | SCP-4074 | \nSCP-4075\n \u00bb",
