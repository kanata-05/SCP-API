Any social media posts involved in an SCP-4613 event are to be archived and removed immediately.\n\n\nOnce an SCP-4613 event is detected, cellphone and internet service to the area experiencing the event is to be suspended. After 4 hours, this suspension may be lifted at the discretion of the SCP-4613 project head.\n\n\nThe SCP-4613 project head must approve the entry of any individuals attempting to enter a location undergoing a SCP-4613 event. Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel allowed to directly interact with any SCP-4613 sufferers.\n\n\nUpdate\n: Tests involving SCP-4613 are to be suspended under all circumstances pending an update to these containment procedures\n1\n.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4613 is a shared delusion predicated on the belief that Edward James Olmos\n2\n (hereafter referred to as SCP-4613-1) will imminently arrive at the location occupied by the sufferer. SCP-4613 sufferers are capable of sharing this delusion among others at the same location through the usage of the phrase \"Edward James Olmos is on his way\".\n\n\nSCP-4613 lasts for approximately 3 hours, after which the originator of the delusion will convince other affected individuals that the event was a hoax. Secondary sufferers will, if separated from the originator of the effect, lose memory of SCP-4613 after the event ends.\n\n\nSCP-4613 events generally originate from an individual that fulfills certain criteria. This includes knowledge of SCP-4613-1's name (plus familiarity with at least one work SCP-4613-1 directed or appeared in) and the ability to communicate vocally.\n\n\nThe SCP-4613 originator will often attempt to inform others of works featuring SCP-4613-1. The vast majority of secondary sufferers will become excited at the prospect of meeting SCP-4613-1, even if they previously knew little or nothing about SCP-4613-1. This will not preclude an individual leaving SCP-4613 affected locations, however.\n\n\nSCP-4613's self-resolving nature makes it difficult to determine how long SCP-4613 has existed. SCP-4613 was first detected by automated social media scraping software utilized in other projects. Social media posts promoting SCP-4613 can attract others to the event, and will persist after the event concludes.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0[Incident\u00a04613-65]\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 13th 2019, an SCP-4613 event occurred at a Denny's restaurant in Clifton Heights, PA. The event was determined to be anomalous despite the fact that SCP-4613-1 was making an appearance nearby. Foundation personnel prevented access to the affected location.\n\n\nThe 4613 project head approved a previously planned test during this 4613 event. The test involved Foundation personnel persuading SCP-4613-1 to visit the location suffering from SCP-4613. This attempt was successful, and a Foundation driver transported SCP-4613-1 to the 4613 event.\n\n\nOnce SCP-4613-1 was within 11 kilometers of the event, SCP-4613 sufferers behaved in a manner inconsistent with previous incidents.
