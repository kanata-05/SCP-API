SCP-2511-A instances held at LKSA are not to be transported out of Mongolia, and are to be fitted with GPS tracking bracelets on one of their limbs.\n\n\nSCP-2511-A instances located in their native settlements are to be monitored via remote underwater drones; see Document 2511-Ka for a list of said settlements.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Kappa-26 (\"Kappa Zulu\") is to be divided into two divisions: K-26-Alpha (based at LKSA) and K-26-Beta (based at Site-49). MTF K-26-Alpha is tasked with the following duties:\n\n\n\n\nOversee relocation of SCP-2511-A instances recovered in Mongolia to LKSA.\n\n\nServe as liaison to the SCP-2511-A community in LKSA.\n\n\nMaintain census record of the total population of SCP-2511-A instances in LKSA. Census is to be updated once every three months.\n\n\n\n\nMTF K-26-Beta is tasked with the following duties:\n\n\n\n\nMonitor SCP-2511-A instances located in their native settlements via remote underwater drones.\n\n\nMaintain census record of the total population of SCP-2511-A instances in native settlements. Census is to be updated once every three months.\n\n\nUpdate (01/10/2002):\n Prevent any pre-adolescent humans from having contact with river bodies where SCP-2511-A settlements are found. If said individuals have contact with said river bodies, MTF K-26-Alpha is to be notified and initiate Procedure 975-Sirius to recover them.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2511 refers to a series of phenomena involving a population of approximately 10,000 specimens of SCP-2511-A. Details of said phenomena are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nA mass teleportation event that occurred on 8 July 1999, whereby approximately 10,000 SCP-2511-A instances were displaced from their native habitats in Northern Kyushu (specifically the Japanese prefectures of Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Kumamoto and \u014cita) to water bodies throughout Mongolia.\n\n\nWhen displaced SCP-2511-A instances exit Mongolia either on foot or via vehicle, they will spontaneously disappear upon crossing Mongolian borders and re-manifest in a location within Mongolia.\n\n\nThe ratio of SCP-2511-A instances in Mongolia to those outside Mongolia is such that the former is consistently larger than the latter. If SCP-2511-A population in Mongolia becomes less than that outside Mongolia, additional SCP-2511-A instances will be displaced from outside Mongolia until the ratio is maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn artist's impression of a suspected SCP-2511-A instance sighted in 1836 CE, deemed to be among the more accurate historic depictions of SCP-2511-A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2511-A refers to a species of bipedal amphibian humanoids, physically resembling the \nAndrias japonicus\n (Japanese giant salamander) yet possessing mammalian traits such as the presence of hair and mammary glands. Average height and mass of SCP-2511-A is 1.50\u00a0m and 60\u00a0kg respectively. SCP-2511-A's native language is an unknown language linguistically related to the Japonic language family, although many are capable of speaking the Saga dialect of Japanese. SCP-2511-A is typically native to settlements found in the rivers of Northern Kyushu, although a population of instances have been found in Mongolia due to SCP-2511 (as stated in paragraph 1 of \nDescription\n).\n\n\nSCP-2511-A's most distinct physical trait is the hemispheric concavity on the head, with an approximate circumference of 35\u00a0cm, usually filled with water. If less than 25% of the concavity's volume is filled with liquid, SCP-2511-A will experience full body paralysis.\n\n\nSCP-2511-A instances were first identified outside Bulgan, Mongolia along the banks of the Orkhon River. Subsequent investigations identified up to 10,000 SCP-2511-A instances, with the highest concentration of instances in the southern shores of Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l. Through interviews with SCP-2511-A instances in LKSA, approximate locations of their native settlements in Japan were identified.\n\n\nAddendum 2511-1:\n Below is an excerpt of a report of identified SCP-2511-A settlements in Northern Kyushu, as observed via underwater drones.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2511-A instances are commonly engaged in the construction of underwater structures similar to tumuli of the Kofun period. However, these tumuli appear to be devoid of corpses and are instead filled with personal effects.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2511-2:\n The following consists of an interview with SCP-2511-A-0126 (\"Chikugo no Kawasaru\"), an SCP-2511-A instance regarded as a literati among the SCP-2511-A community.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0View\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a02511-A-0126-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewee:\n SCP-2511-A-0126\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Misako MacMorrow\n\n\nForeword:\n The following interview is originally conducted in the Saga dialect of Japanese.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n Good morning to you, may we have your name for records?\n\n\n[SCP-2511-A-0126 stares blankly at Dr. MacMorrow.]\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n Excuse me, is there anything wrong?\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n No, nothing is wrong. It is just odd and intriguing that your kind still survive to this day.\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n It may feel awkward to say this, but your kind are creatures of myth to us \u2013 the Children of the Sun that walk the day. There were legends our forefathers had written, the Day of Flowers when your kind overcame the \nChildren of the Night\n.\n1\n But I am really amazed to see one such Child of the Sun upfront and so amiable.\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n I am flattered by your claims. But may I ask for your name? You may call me Misako.\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n Misako-san, what is your source name?\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n Excuse me, please elaborate.\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n The name of your home river. In my case, since I am from the Chikugo River, I am Chikugo no Kawasaru.\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n Kawasaru-san, we of the surface won't have a source name.\n\n\n[SCP-2511-A-0126 sighs.]\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n Ah, the Chikugo. My parents would be most worried for me.\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n It will be alright. We are here to help you, but we also need you to cooperate with us and tell us what happened before you ended up here.\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n I don't know, it was an ordinary day before this happened. I slept for the night as usual and the next day, I felt that the water tasted differently. When I opened my eyes, that's when I realised I was no longer at home and here I am.\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n Thank you for the account. Is there anything peculiar prior to the event?\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n Nothing much, all was ordinary. But I do remember having a dream the night before. There was some incantation echoing in my mind, as though it were a demonic curse.\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n Can you recall any bit of it?\n\n\nSCP-2511-A-0126:\n \nza kappa izu m\u014d k\u014dmanr\u012b faundo in mang\u014dr\u012ba\n.\n2\n I'm sure it's about my kind, but what is a \nmang\u014dr\u012ba\n exactly?\n\n\nDr. MacMorrow:\n I believe you mean Mongolia.
