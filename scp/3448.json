Personnel are to inspect SCP-3448 daily for additional messages from SCP-3448-A. Project Dammerung is to research any method of escape proposed or indicated by SCP-3448-A.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3448 refers to the communication developed and used by Project Dammerung. Utilizing technology used in MRIs, particle accelerators, and anomalous rituals, SCP-3448 is capable of allowing an individual to die while remaining in contact with the world of the living. SCP-3448 resembles an MRI machine; however, its additional anomalous components are connected externally through the use of jumper cables and custom circuit boards.\n\n\nSCP-3448 is the primary tool used by Project Dammerung to complete its objective: to contain the Dammerung Class Cognitohazard known as death.\n\n\nSubjects are introduced to SCP-3448 through its main opening. Once the subject has fully entered the cavity, the anomalous components in SCP-3448 transfer the subject into a half-death\n1\n state, in which all bodily functions cease. Any subject occupying this conceptual state is referred to as SCP-3448-A. This allows the consciousness to roam free from the body after it has entered the state of death (henceforth referred to as SCP-3448-1). Unfortunately, most documentation about the nature of SCP-3448-1 has been lost (see Addendum 3448.1).\n\n\nWhen the consciousness leaves the brain in this manner, anomalous electrical activity continues, despite any source of energy. This activity is referred to as residual signals, which replicate how the brain would react should it be introduced to SCP-3448-1 while it was alive.\n2\n By interacting with these electrical signals, the Foundation is able to establish two-way communication with SCP-3448-A.\n\n\nIn order to better understand the residual signals, they are interpreted by an additional anomalous component of SCP-3448. This component will generally produce an image, although individual words have been observed.\n\n\nAgent Anthony Michaels, the only successful subject to have utilized SCP-3448 outside of preliminary testing, is the current SCP-3448-A. As of this writing, SCP-3448-A still exhibits standard residual signal activity.\n\n\nAddendum 3448.1:\n Below is a series of records from the usage of SCP-3448. Due to the destruction of formal testing documentation as per the instructions of O5-4, the majority of recovered documents take the form of lab notes, or residual signal communication reports.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Recovered\u00a0Interview\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Preliminary Subject Interview\n\n\nYoung:\n Please state your name for the record.\n\n\nMichaels:\n Agent Anthony Michaels.\n\n\nYoung:\n How long have you served the Foundation?\n\n\nMichaels:\n Fourteen years.\n\n\nYoung:\n What is your next assignment?\n\n\nMichaels:\n The one that'll make sure I don't serve for fifteen years.\n\n\nYoung:\n \u2026 You know this is for the formal record, right?\n\n\nMichaels:\n Yeah, but you know how it is. I gotta get a joke in some time. And we both know I only have so many jokes left.\n\n\nYoung:\n I know, I know. But, let's just get back to the interview for now. Why did you volunteer for this assignment?\n\n\nMichaels:\n I did it for my family.\n\n\nYoung:\n Can you elaborate?\n\n\nMichaels:\n Well, my dad's been on his deathbed for a while now. I've spoken to him though, and once he comes around he talks about the things he was going to do when he gets out of the hospital. He told me he was going to hike the Appalachian trail. That thing goes all the way from Georgia to Maine. This man brought up three kids by himself, and all he wanted at the end was to go on a nice hike.\n\n\nYoung:\n That doesn't quite answer the question.\n\n\nMichaels:\n Yeah, I guess it's not a super explicit answer isn't it? \n[laughs softly]\n\n\nYoung:\n Please, we need to do this for the report. It has to be more professional than this.\n\n\nMichaels:\n Sorry, sorry. I meant to say that, well\u2026 I want to give my dad another chance. Sure, he might not make it all the way through the trail, or up the mountains, or wherever, but I don't want him to die. He deserves more than what he's got, and I'm willing to sacrifice myself in his stead. He's practically done the same for me.\n\n\nYoung:\n And you do recognize that the Foundation is not required to adhere to your wish. This meaning that, in the case that your mission succeeds, we are allowed to choose your father for selective termination.\n\n\nMichaels:\n I'll take the chance. If we're containing the Reaper, I trust the Foundation will make sure he's only let off his new leash when it's really necessary. Furthermore, I don't believe my dad is one of those cases.\n\n\nYoung:\n Do you have anything else to add?\n\n\nMichaels:\n I guess I'd like to thank you for giving me this opportunity.\n\n\nYoung:\n Well, um\u2026 It's been my pleasure, Agent Michaels.\n\n\nMichaels:\n As working with Project Dammerung was mine.\n\n\nYoung:\n Okay. That will conclude our interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Imaging\u00a0Reports\u00a0and\u00a0Associated\u00a0Lab\u00a0Notes\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Preliminary Testing Lab Notes\n\n\nAlright, breaking in the first page of the lab notebook. Just a bunch of scribbles of my thoughts during the official test for later. So, to future reader person (yes, that means you future Emily), you should probably take a look at the formal report instead.\n\n\nWe've confirmed that this thing works as well as it's ever going to. I mean, the animal tests of the individual parts worked. That's the best confirmation we're going to get without throwing someone in there 100%.\n\n\nSo, the current plan is this - send in Michaels and have him look around. Get him to investigate and learn what this place is like, who else is there, etc. Then, we will then use our newfound understanding of the Reaper to figure out how to contain him. Finally we'll\u2026 we'll do our job I guess. It's our Dammerung-Class Moby Dick after all. Except without the killing it part.\n\n\nMichaels finished training to use SCP-3448 a few days ago. Not sure how quickly he'll be able to adjust to being dead, which means that we don't know how long it'll be until he can actually talk to us right. But now's as good a time as any. Worst comes to worst, I love the guy, but he's already going to be dead. We just let the man rest in peace.\n\n\nToo bad we couldn't use a Class-D, but the higher-ups don't trust that they'll listen to orders. It's not like we could threaten termination.\n\n\nI caught Tony clearing out his quarters today. When I asked him how he was feeling he made some joke like \u201cit\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to kill me twice\u201d. And then he threw out a box of personal mementos, including that teddy bear I gave him at the Foundation Christmas gift exchange. He can\u2019t be doing too well. But, then again, he\u2019s probably as ready as he\u2019ll ever be.\n\n\nThat teddy bear is now in my office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 1 Imaging Results\n\n\n<08:30 \u2014 09:00>\n Intense flashing and flickering.\n\n\n\n\n<09:00 \u2014 09:05>\n Image resembled rough seas.\n\n\n<09:05 \u2014 12:05>\n Intense flashing and flickering.\n\n\n<12:05 \u2014 12:48>\n Formed three hours after the previous image. Appears to be a humanoid figure surrounded by hundreds of insects. This continues for 43 minutes before the insects disperse; the now considerably swollen humanoid falls to the ground.\n\n\n<12:48 \u2014 18:48>\n A shade of grey.\n\n\n<18:48 \u2014 23:52>\n Appears to resemble the rough seas from the 08:30\u201409:00 image, however, the water is replaced with the insects from the 12:05\u201412:48 image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 1 Lab Notes\n\n\nIt's working. It's not going well, but it's working. God, what the hell was Tony thinking when he signed up for this shit?\n\n\nWe knew that death was supposed to get worse and worse as it went. At least, that's how the recording described it. We thought that preserving the body would reduce some of the perception issues, but I don't think it\u2019s working as well as we wanted. But it's just the first day. Our plan gives us ten days before we jump ship and move on to another subject.\n\n\nAlso, we need to move Jared to a different station. He vomited all over the floor during his monitoring shift. I don't totally blame him, but he could've done the rest of us a favor by hobbling off to the bathroom faster. Hopefully Tony won't send back too many more visuals like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 2 Imaging Results\n\n\n<02:00 \u2014 02:03>\n An emaciated man lying in a desert. There appears to be an oasis far in the background.\n\n\n<02:03 \u2014 10:03>\n Static.\n\n\n\n\n<06:00 \u2014 12:00>\n A man in the fetal position, laying in the corner of a room made of compacted dirt. Various bones and roots can be seen protruding from the walls.\n\n\n<\n12:00 \u2014 18:00>\n Insect wings emerge from the walls and begin fluttering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 2 Lab Notes\n\n\nOk, looks like he's calmed down. Not entirely coherent, but it's something. We're going to see if we can talk to him tomorrow. I say talk but I really mean mess with his brain waves in a meaningful way. We know it \nworks\n, but we have no clue what it actually feels like. Hard to get that sort of feedback from lab rats.\n\n\nBut if these tests work we're onto something. We'll get him to start exploring I guess? I don't think that's the right word. Or maybe it is. We don't know if this is a place or a state of mind or what. The recording that O5-4 showed us makes it sound like he's still here, on earth. Just experiencing things in the most terrible way possible. I'm more picturing a hellscape aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 3 Imaging Results\n\n\n<06:00 \u2014 06:03>\n A caterpillar crawling up the trunk of a tree.\n\n\n<08:03 \u2014 08:13>\n Leaves blowing in the wind. The direction of the breeze alternates rapidly, so the leaves appear to be waving.\n\n\n<09:13 \u2014 09:15>\n The caterpillar from the 06:00\u201406:03 image eats some of the leaves from the 08:03\u201408:13 image.\n\n\n<09:15 \u2014 13:15>\n Various shades of red.\n\n\n<13:15 \u2014 13:15>\n An emaciated man punches a wall.\n\n\n<15:15 \u2014 15:29>\n Same scene from the 09:13\u201409:15 image, except the caterpillar has stopped eating, and the leaves have all been replaced by hands of the same size, which continue to wave in the wind. This continues for ten minutes until the wind stops. All hands except for one hang limply. The remaining hand makes an \"ok\" sign. The caterpillar begins to wrap itself in a cocoon.\n\n\n<19:29 \u2014 21:03>\n The hands from the previous image move frantically to swat away insects. Insects do not resemble a single known species. They have stingers resembling those of bees, and legs resembling those of spiders. The caterpillar has fully formed its cocoon, and is undisturbed for the duration of the visual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 3 Lab Notes\n\n\nHe's finally becoming coherent, so thank god for that. I mean, I use coherent lightly. He's as together as a consciousness floating through space could ever be. He waved to say \"Hi\" (I think). So this is fine.\n\n\nIn other news, I talked to Tony's sister, Joyce. Apparently she works in the biology department at Site-23. I didn't tell her about what's up with Tony, of course. But, I did manage to bring up insects. Apparently Tony has some sort of insectophobia, but it's not too bad that you'd call it a phobia. Like, they just freak him out.\n\n\nEither way, it makes for some interesting interpretations of Tony's visuals. I can't tell if SCP-3448-1 is full of bugs, or if it's full of whatever you're afraid of, or if that's just Tony's interpretation of it. I'm leaning toward the last option though. If anything because of an idealogical standpoint. Death being what you make of it sounds kind of poetic. Not that any of my \"poetry\" will show up in the formal report.\n\n\nI wonder what I'd see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill from the Day 4, 10:00-14:22 image. Neither the man, nor the hedges are visible at this point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 4 Imaging Results\n\n\n<10:00 \u2014 14:22>\n A man searches through a garden. It is unclear what he is looking for. The garden extends indefinitely in all directions, and exploration takes the man through large groves of daisies. For the majority of the trek, the man stays on a path outlined by two hedges that run alongside him. At one point the man stops, looks at a patch of daisies, and steps over the hedges toward the flowers. Image changes after his foot hits the ground.\n\n\n<14:22 \u2014 17:22>\n Various shades of green and purple.\n\n\n<17:22 \u2014 17:27>\n The man from the 10:00\u201414:22 image has uncovered some of the dirt, and stares into the ground with a look of awe and terror on his face. What the man is staring at is obscured by daisies. After three minutes, a thin, wrinkled hand is seen reaching into frame, and taps the man on the shoulder.\n\n\n<17:27 \u2014 18:27>\n Static.\n\n\n<18:27 \u2014 18:39>\n The man is standing behind the hedges now. A small girl is covering the patch of land with dirt using her hands. A large quantity of insects swarm around the girl. She appears content. It is unknown if the girl acknowledges the insects or not. The man's left hand appears to be swollen from stinging.\n\n\n<23:39 \u2014 01:02>\n The man walks back through the garden the way he came in Image 1. Left hand remains swollen. He is carrying a tulip in his right hand, which he looks at during the walk. No other individuals can be seen. After an hour and eight minutes, the man suddenly looks back over his shoulder, shrugs and continues walking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 4 Lab Notes:\n\n\nExploration started today. And by exploration I mean Tony actively figuring out how to convey this place to us. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually all flowers and sunshine. Luckily, he seems to be mostly coherent at this point. Although, I think his communication is still more cryptic than we\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take it over how he acted a few days ago.\n\n\nWe don\u2019t know who the girl is. Can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s supposed to represent. Most of us think that she\u2019s another person caught in this \u201chalf-dead\u201d state, but we don\u2019t have any confirmation. Although, on the off chance we\u2019re right, the higher ups started an operation to infiltrate the usual suspects (CI, SH, GOC, etc.) to make sure none of them have beaten us to the punch.\n\n\nAssuming Tony understands us well enough, we\u2019re going to give him the go ahead to interact more with the girl and report back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 5 Imaging Results:\n\n\n<05:00 \u2014 05:20>\n A sky covered in gray clouds.

The girl offers tea to both the teddy bear and the crow. Neither party reacts. She proceeds to pour tea for the two regardless.\n\n\n<10:30 \u2014 13:30>\n A warm shade of yellow.\n\n\n<13:30 \u2014 14:16>\n Same as the 10:20\u201410:30 image except the teddy bear somehow has a grip on the tea cup, and the crow is facing the teddy bear. The girl appears to be conversing with the stuffed animals, despite their lack of responses.\n\n\n<14:16 \u2014 15:16>\n A light shade of red.\n\n\n<15:16 \u2014 15:38>\n Same as the 13:30\u201414:16 image, except the crow has started to fall apart at the seams. Insects crawl out from between the stitching. Neither the teddy bear nor the girl appear to notice.\n\n\n<15:38 \u2014 16:38>\n Flickering between dark red, and black.\n\n\n<16:38 \u2014 16:44>\n Formed at 1600. Same as Image 4, except the insects have eaten parts of the teddy bear. The girl appears surprised and upset. After five minutes she glares at the stuffed crow, which is now mostly covered with insects. She then sets down her tea, and leaves.\n\n\n<19:44 \u2014 20:04>\n A man in the corner of a room, curled into the fetal position. He rocks back and forth. His body appears to be swollen and covered from small insect bites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 5 Lab Notes:\n\n\nI think half of our group is starting to get more and more uncomfortable with the creepy crawlies. I can only imagine what it\u2019s like for Tony. We\u2019re giving him a day to recuperate from whatever the hell today was. No exploration or interviews or whatever.\n\n\nIn other news, we made some progress on the girl today. She looks almost identical to Tony\u2019s younger sister Joyce from when she was eight. Key word \u2013 \"almost\". I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s Tony not quite getting the image back right, or if this thing actually just looks like Tony\u2019s sister but with slightly elevated cheek bones and a slightly darker shade of brown in her hair. Or maybe that\u2019s how Tony remembers his sister? Or maybe there\u2019s just some kid out there who looks almost like her?\n\n\nHonestly, those details probably aren't super important. I bet tomorrow our \"talk\" with Tony will clear things up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 6 Imaging Results:\n\n\n<10:00 \u2014 10:05>\n A man sitting with his back against a dirt wall. Plant roots and bones protrude from the wall and ceiling. He appears to be tired and sweating.\n\n\n<12:05 \u2014 12:08>\n A single question mark.\n\n\n<13:08 \u2014 13:14>\n The man from the 10:00\u201410:05 image is holding a doll of a small girl, and a doll of a crow. He positions them next to each other, with the girl\u2019s arm around the crow, and the crow\u2019s wing around the girl.\n\n\n<14:14 \u2014 14:14>\n The man shrugs.\n\n\n<23:00 \u2014 23:13>\n The man is sitting with his back against the wall of the room again. After five minutes, his head jerks to look off screen. He quickly gets up and rushes out of the room through the opposite direction. After three minutes a swarm of insects enters the screen.\n\n\n<23:13 \u2014 24:00>\n White.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 6 Lab Notes:\n\n\nShit.\n \nShit shit shit.\n \nHe\u2019s fucked\n \nDamn it tony\n\n\nFuck.\n\n\nOk, ok. Breather. Sorry future me, I shouldn\u2019t use these notes for venting. Luckily it won\u2019t show up in the formal report.\n\n\nAnyways. Tony was\u2026 well he didn\u2019t learn much about the girl. At least not much that he told us. I think she\u2019s friends with the bugs? Or with the crow thing at least. Or maybe they\u2019re the same entity? They\u2019re definitely connected.\n\n\nNow we\u2019re all waiting for Tony to get back to us. Luckily, we\u2019ve got coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 7 Imaging Results:\n\n\n<16:00 \u2014 16:43>\n A man running through the garden of daisies. He appears to be limping slightly, and checks over his shoulder at regular intervals.\n\n\n<16:43 \u2014 19:07>\n Flashing between bright red and black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 7 Lab notes:\n\n\nThat was it. He\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s just still running.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been trying to think of something to help him. Jared floated the idea of sending him some bug spray. I know he was joking, because Jared can't help himself from being a wise-ass when he's stressed out, but maybe he's onto something. Going to look into how to send Tony a care package tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 8 Imaging Results:\n\n\n<02:00 \u2014 02:43>\n A man is running through a garden. After thirty minutes, he passes by a girl, who appears to be planting something. He calls out to her. The girl turns around. She is planting another daisy. The man rushes to the girl, and takes her by the hand. The girl begins to say something, but is cut short as the man pulls her back to the path and resumes running. The newly planted daisy remains the focus of the image for another two minutes before it is overrun with insects.\n\n\n<02:43 \u2014 10:56>\n White.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 8 Lab Notes:\n\n\nOk, we've got something. It's a little out there. But it's all we've come up with.\n\n\nSo, Tony\u2019s in a half-death state, right? But it\u2019s not like this is a conventional afterlife deal. It was built around a more abstract, conceptual representation of death. So that means that, all \u201chalf-dead\u201d things could end up there, right? Well, ok the dead things end up there too but we\u2019re less sure what exactly that looks like.\n\n\nBut, I can't believe I'm even writing this, what if we half kill a \nthing\n. Ok, yes that is as dumb as it sounds, \nbut\n, we want to send something in there to help Tony. We don't have another agent who was as willing as him to take up this assignment, and I'll be damned if we lose our best shot at exploring this place. I don\u2019t know if Tony has things, or how inanimate objects really work on the other side. But we're grasping at straws anyways.\n\n\nJared figured if we\u2019re going to send him something, we should send him some form of self-defense. Unfortunately, we're a little short handed in terms of weaponry. So we're going to send him the next best thing - a lighter. Bugs don't like fire, right? I mean, maybe they're not literally bugs, but fire is generally effective against things. Either way it'll work fine to test it.\n\n\nProcedures:\n\n\n1. Partially disassemble the lighter.\n\n\n2. Place lighter in SCP-3448.\n\n\n3. Activate SCP-3448, and at the same time try to finish disassembling the lighter? (maybe use like a firecracker for this? Or like a mousetrap? I don't know, we'll figure it out)\n\n\nGod, killing a lighter sounds so dumb. But fuck it we\u2019re gonna try.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill from the Day 9, 17:31 - 17:54 image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 9 Imaging Results:\n\n\n<04:00 \u2014 04:04>\n Formed at 0400. A man running through a garden carrying a lighter in one hand, and pulling a girl behind him with the other. As the man runs, he looks confusedly at the device. After four minutes, he pockets the lighter.\n\n\n<10:04 \u2014 10:29>\n A teddy bear the size of an average human sits against a door to a room. The walls consist of mud and dirt, with bones and roots sticking out. The girl from the 04:00\u201404:04 sits at the opposite end of the room with her legs pulled against her chest. She rocks back and forth slowly for three minutes before walking to the teddy bear. She begins to speak as she tugs on the teddy bear's legs. The girl appears to age rapidly the more she begs. The teddy bear does not move.\n\n\n<16:29 \u2014 16:31>\n A man is standing in a garden. He is constantly stung/bitten by a thick swarm of insects. A girl screams at him from nearby, ignored by the insects. The man looks at the girl, screams something back, and then reaches into his pocket.\n\n\n<16:31 \u2014 17:31>\n Red static.\n\n\n<17:31 \u2014 17:54>\n A bonfire.\n\n\n<17:54 \u2014 20:54>\n Grey.\n\n\n<20:54 \u2014 23:54>\n A girl repeatedly stabs a man lying on the ground with a sharpened femur. They are surrounded by burnt insect corpses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 9 Lab Notes\n\n\nHoly fuck.\n\n\nIt worked.\n\n\nAnd then he\u2026 fuck I don't know what really happened. This entire past week has felt like I've been watching someone's acid trip.\n\n\nOk, we still don't know what that girl is, but stabbing Tony means she's hostile, which means we need to do something. I called in a favor and got a handgun delivered here. Same procedure as with the lighter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 10 Imaging Results\n\n\n<01:54 \u2014 03:01>\n An old woman beats a man lying on the ground with a femur. They are surrounded by burnt insect corpses, some of which are moving.\n\n\n<03:01 \u2014 04:01>\n A little girl is straddling a man with her arms in the air. The man aims a handgun at her. They are surrounded by teddy bears, all of which are looking at the girl.\n\n\n<04:01 \u2014 04:03>\n A cocoon sits on a tree branch where all of the leaves are replaced with hands. The cocoon breaks open, and a moth exits.\n\n\n<05:00 \u2014 05:02>\n Same as the 03:01 \u2014 04:01 image, except the teddy bears are all grasping lighters with the flames exposed, and all of the garden is on fire. A bullet can be seen halfway between the handgun, and the girl's head.\n\n\n<05:02 \u2014 06:00>\n Bright red.\n\n\n<06:00 \u2014 06:00>\n Same as previous image, except the flowers are replaced with chains, which are still burning. The girl has been replaced with a skeleton, but her hair remains. The man has become further emaciated and also resembles a skeleton. A chain wraps itself around both the man and the skeleton of the girl. Teddy bears look on from the darkness.\n\n\n<06:00 \u2014 07:00>\n Dark red.\n\n\n<07:00 \u2014 07:02>\n The bullet penetrates the girl's head.\n\n\n<07:02 \u2014 13:02>\n Static.\n\n\n<13:02 \u2014 13:16>\n A man stands in the middle of a garden. All of the flowers that can be seen are blooming. Insect corpses rain from the sky. The girl is no longer present. A stuffed animal crow lies next to Tony with a bullet-sized hole in its head. After thirteen minutes the following words appear at the bottom of the screen: \"I hope you enjoy your hike, dad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3448 Day 10 Lab Notes\n\n\nOh fuck.\n\n\nWhat even just.\n\n\nShit.\n\n\nI don't think I've ever been so torn over one of my experiments working twice in a row.\n\n\nBut still he\u2014 he shot her. I mean of course he would, we gave him the gun but I can't believe it. Like, I didn't actually think that was going to happen. Again, what else was going to happen? But just\u2026 FUCK\n\n\nThen like, five minutes later the calls started. First it was from Joyce talking about how her father wasn't dying. I'd told her to contact me if anything strange started happening with her family which might be related to Tony but this wasn't a calm informative call. She was just so \nexcited\n \npanicked\n \necstatic\n \nterrified\n I don't fucking know.\n\n\nAfter that was the call from O5-4. Only council member that knew about our little project. Signed off on the funding and everything. He congratulated me on our success, and then told me to burn it all. That's probably when it sunk in. It really should've been apparent from the start. It was in our contracts, it's what we told people on their first day: \"This project has a single objective - contain the Dammerung Class cognitohazard known as death\".\n\n\nWe did it? No, we really didn't do it. All those years of theorizing and studying the data, scouring anomalous burial sites and hauls from MTF raids. And finally, we come face to face with the reaper. And what do we do? We fucking shoot \nhim\n her. Now all we have is a tombstone reading Rest In Peace: Resting in Peace.\n\n\nWe fucked up.\n\n\nWe didn't contain death.\n\n\nWe neutralized it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Death here is referred to as a conceptual form of death. This is distinct from any notion of afterlife, and is not restricted necessarily to organisms.\n\n\n2\n. This means that the residual signals reflect the activity of the brain if it were exposed to the same stimuli as the conceptual representation of the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3447\n | SCP-3448 | \nSCP-3449\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3448\n\" by Captain Kirby, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.

        "SCP-3448 Preliminary Subject Interview Young: Please state your name for the record. Michaels: Agent Anthony Michaels. Young: How long have you served the Foundation? Michaels: Fourteen years. Young: What is your next assignment? Michaels: The one that'll make sure I don't serve for fifteen years. Young: \u2026 You know this is for the formal record, right? Michaels: Yeah, but you know how it is. I gotta get a joke in some time. And we both know I only have so many jokes left. Young: I know, I know. But, let's just get back to the interview for now. Why did you volunteer for this assignment? Michaels: I did it for my family. Young: Can you elaborate? Michaels: Well, my dad's been on his deathbed for a while now. I've spoken to him though, and once he comes around he talks about the things he was going to do when he gets out of the hospital. He told me he was going to hike the Appalachian trail. That thing goes all the way from Georgia to Maine. This man brought up three kids by himself, and all he wanted at the end was to go on a nice hike. Young: That doesn't quite answer the question. Michaels: Yeah, I guess it's not a super explicit answer isn't it? [laughs softly] Young: Please, we need to do this for the report. It has to be more professional than this. Michaels: Sorry, sorry. I meant to say that, well\u2026 I want to give my dad another chance. Sure, he might not make it all the way through the trail, or up the mountains, or wherever, but I don't want him to die. He deserves more than what he's got, and I'm willing to sacrifice myself in his stead. He's practically done the same for me. Young: And you do recognize that the Foundation is not required to adhere to your wish. This meaning that, in the case that your mission succeeds, we are allowed to choose your father for selective termination. Michaels: I'll take the chance. If we're containing the Reaper, I trust the Foundation will make sure he's only let off his new leash when it's really necessary. Furthermore, I don't believe my dad is one of those cases. Young: Do you have anything else to add? Michaels: I guess I'd like to thank you for giving me this opportunity. Young: Well, um\u2026 It's been my pleasure, Agent Michaels. Michaels: As working with Project Dammerung was mine. Young: Okay. That will conclude our interview.",
        "SCP-3448 Preliminary Testing Lab Notes Alright, breaking in the first page of the lab notebook. Just a bunch of scribbles of my thoughts during the official test for later. So, to future reader person (yes, that means you future Emily), you should probably take a look at the formal report instead. We've confirmed that this thing works as well as it's ever going to. I mean, the animal tests of the individual parts worked. That's the best confirmation we're going to get without throwing someone in there 100%. So, the current plan is this - send in Michaels and have him look around. Get him to investigate and learn what this place is like, who else is there, etc. Then, we will then use our newfound understanding of the Reaper to figure out how to contain him. Finally we'll\u2026 we'll do our job I guess. It's our Dammerung-Class Moby Dick after all. Except without the killing it part. Michaels finished training to use SCP-3448 a few days ago. Not sure how quickly he'll be able to adjust to being dead, which means that we don't know how long it'll be until he can actually talk to us right. But now's as good a time as any. Worst comes to worst, I love the guy, but he's already going to be dead. We just let the man rest in peace. Too bad we couldn't use a Class-D, but the higher-ups don't trust that they'll listen to orders. It's not like we could threaten termination. I caught Tony clearing out his quarters today. When I asked him how he was feeling he made some joke like \u201cit\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to kill me twice\u201d. And then he threw out a box of personal mementos, including that teddy bear I gave him at the Foundation Christmas gift exchange. He can\u2019t be doing too well. But, then again, he\u2019s probably as ready as he\u2019ll ever be. That teddy bear is now in my office.",

        "SCP-3448 Day 1 Lab Notes It's working. It's not going well, but it's working. God, what the hell was Tony thinking when he signed up for this shit? We knew that death was supposed to get worse and worse as it went. At least, that's how the recording described it. We thought that preserving the body would reduce some of the perception issues, but I don't think it\u2019s working as well as we wanted. But it's just the first day. Our plan gives us ten days before we jump ship and move on to another subject. Also, we need to move Jared to a different station. He vomited all over the floor during his monitoring shift. I don't totally blame him, but he could've done the rest of us a favor by hobbling off to the bathroom faster. Hopefully Tony won't send back too many more visuals like that.",

I say talk but I really mean mess with his brain waves in a meaningful way. We know it works , but we have no clue what it actually feels like. Hard to get that sort of feedback from lab rats. But if these tests work we're onto something. We'll get him to start exploring I guess? I don't think that's the right word. Or maybe it is. We don't know if this is a place or a state of mind or what. The recording that O5-4 showed us makes it sound like he's still here, on earth.

        "SCP-3448 Day 3 Lab Notes He's finally becoming coherent, so thank god for that. I mean, I use coherent lightly. He's as together as a consciousness floating through space could ever be. He waved to say \"Hi\" (I think). So this is fine. In other news, I talked to Tony's sister, Joyce. Apparently she works in the biology department at Site-23. I didn't tell her about what's up with Tony, of course. But, I did manage to bring up insects. Apparently Tony has some sort of insectophobia, but it's not too bad that you'd call it a phobia. Like, they just freak him out. Either way, it makes for some interesting interpretations of Tony's visuals. I can't tell if SCP-3448-1 is full of bugs, or if it's full of whatever you're afraid of, or if that's just Tony's interpretation of it. I'm leaning toward the last option though. If anything because of an idealogical standpoint. Death being what you make of it sounds kind of poetic. Not that any of my \"poetry\" will show up in the formal report. I wonder what I'd see.",

The man's left hand appears to be swollen from stinging. <23:39 \u2014 01:02> The man walks back through the garden the way he came in Image 1. Left hand remains swollen. He is carrying a tulip in his right hand, which he looks at during the walk. No other individuals can be seen. After an hour and eight minutes, the man suddenly looks back over his shoulder, shrugs and continues walking.",
        "SCP-3448 Day 4 Lab Notes: Exploration started today. And by exploration I mean Tony actively figuring out how to convey this place to us. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually all flowers and sunshine. Luckily, he seems to be mostly coherent at this point. Although, I think his communication is still more cryptic than we\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take it over how he acted a few days ago. We don\u2019t know who the girl is. Can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s supposed to represent. Most of us think that she\u2019s another person caught in this \u201chalf-dead\u201d state, but we don\u2019t have any confirmation. Although, on the off chance we\u2019re right, the higher ups started an operation to infiltrate the usual suspects (CI, SH, GOC, etc.) to make sure none of them have beaten us to the punch. Assuming Tony understands us well enough, we\u2019re going to give him the go ahead to interact more with the girl and report back.",

No precipitation observed. <05:20 \u2014 10:20> Static. <10:20 \u2014 10:30> A teddy bear, a stuffed animal crow, and a girl all sit around a table. The girl offers tea to both the teddy bear and the crow. Neither party reacts. She proceeds to pour tea for the two regardless. <10:30 \u2014 13:30> A warm shade of yellow. <13:30 \u2014 14:16> Same as the 10:20\u201410:30 image except the teddy bear somehow has a grip on the tea cup, and the crow is facing the teddy bear. The girl appears to be conversing with the stuffed animals, despite their lack of responses. <14:16 \u2014 15:16> A light shade of red. <15:16 \u2014 15:38> Same as the 13:30\u201414:16 image, except the crow has started to fall apart at the seams. Insects crawl out from between the stitching. Neither the teddy bear nor the girl appear to notice. <15:38 \u2014 16:38> Flickering between dark red, and black. <16:38 \u2014 16:44> Formed at 1600. Same as Image 4, except the insects have eaten parts of the teddy bear. The girl appears surprised and upset. After five minutes she glares at the stuffed crow, which is now mostly covered with insects. She then sets down her tea, and leaves. <19:44 \u2014 20:04> A man in the corner of a room, curled into the fetal position. He rocks back and forth. His body appears to be swollen and covered from small insect bites.",
        "SCP-3448 Day 5 Lab Notes: I think half of our group is starting to get more and more uncomfortable with the creepy crawlies. I can only imagine what it\u2019s like for Tony. We\u2019re giving him a day to recuperate from whatever the hell today was. No exploration or interviews or whatever. In other news, we made some progress on the girl today. She looks almost identical to Tony\u2019s younger sister Joyce from when she was eight. Key word \u2013 \"almost\". I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s Tony not quite getting the image back right, or if this thing actually just looks like Tony\u2019s sister but with slightly elevated cheek bones and a slightly darker shade of brown in her hair. Or maybe that\u2019s how Tony remembers his sister? Or maybe there\u2019s just some kid out there who looks almost like her? Honestly, those details probably aren't super important. I bet tomorrow our \"talk\" with Tony will clear things up.",

He appears to be tired and sweating. <12:05 \u2014 12:08> A single question mark. <13:08 \u2014 13:14> The man from the 10:00\u201410:05 image is holding a doll of a small girl, and a doll of a crow. He positions them next to each other, with the girl\u2019s arm around the crow, and the crow\u2019s wing around the girl. <14:14 \u2014 14:14> The man shrugs. <23:00 \u2014 23:13> The man is sitting with his back against the wall of the room again. After five minutes, his head jerks to look off screen. He quickly gets up and rushes out of the room through the opposite direction. After three minutes a swarm of insects enters the screen. <23:13 \u2014 24:00> White.",
        "Day 6 Lab Notes: Shit. Shit shit shit. He\u2019s fucked Damn it tony Fuck. Ok, ok. Breather. Sorry future me, I shouldn\u2019t use these notes for venting. Luckily it won\u2019t show up in the formal report. Anyways. Tony was\u2026 well he didn\u2019t learn much about the girl. At least not much that he told us. I think she\u2019s friends with the bugs? Or with the crow thing at least. Or maybe they\u2019re the same entity? They\u2019re definitely connected. Now we\u2019re all waiting for Tony to get back to us. Luckily, we\u2019ve got coffee.",

        "SCP-3448 Day 7 Lab notes: That was it. He\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s just still running. We\u2019ve been trying to think of something to help him. Jared floated the idea of sending him some bug spray. I know he was joking, because Jared can't help himself from being a wise-ass when he's stressed out, but maybe he's onto something. Going to look into how to send Tony a care package tomorrow.",
        "SCP-3448 Day 8 Imaging Results: <02:00 \u2014 02:43> A man is running through a garden. After thirty minutes, he passes by a girl, who appears to be planting something. He calls out to her. The girl turns around. She is planting another daisy. The man rushes to the girl, and takes her by the hand. The girl begins to say something, but is cut short as the man pulls her back to the path and resumes running. The newly planted daisy remains the focus of the image for another two minutes before it is overrun with insects. <02:43 \u2014 10:56> White.",
        "SCP-3448 Day 8 Lab Notes: Ok, we've got something. It's a little out there. But it's all we've come up with. So, Tony\u2019s in a half-death state, right? But it\u2019s not like this is a conventional afterlife deal. It was built around a more abstract, conceptual representation of death. So that means that, all \u201chalf-dead\u201d things could end up there, right? Well, ok the dead things end up there too but we\u2019re less sure what exactly that looks like. But, I can't believe I'm even writing this, what if we half kill a thing . Ok, yes that is as dumb as it sounds, but , we want to send something in there to help Tony. We don't have another agent who was as willing as him to take up this assignment, and I'll be damned if we lose our best shot at exploring this place. I don\u2019t know if Tony has things, or how inanimate objects really work on the other side. But we're grasping at straws anyways. Jared figured if we\u2019re going to send him something, we should send him some form of self-defense. Unfortunately, we're a little short handed in terms of weaponry. So we're going to send him the next best thing - a lighter. Bugs don't like fire, right? I mean, maybe they're not literally bugs, but fire is generally effective against things. Either way it'll work fine to test it. Procedures: 1. Partially disassemble the lighter. 2. Place lighter in SCP-3448. 3. Activate SCP-3448, and at the same time try to finish disassembling the lighter? (maybe use like a firecracker for this? Or like a mousetrap? I don't know, we'll figure it out) God, killing a lighter sounds so dumb. But fuck it we\u2019re gonna try.",

A man running through a garden carrying a lighter in one hand, and pulling a girl behind him with the other. As the man runs, he looks confusedly at the device. After four minutes, he pockets the lighter. <10:04 \u2014 10:29> A teddy bear the size of an average human sits against a door to a room. The walls consist of mud and dirt, with bones and roots sticking out. The girl from the 04:00\u201404:04 sits at the opposite end of the room with her legs pulled against her chest. She rocks back and forth slowly for three minutes before walking to the teddy bear. She begins to speak as she tugs on the teddy bear's legs. The girl appears to age rapidly the more she begs. The teddy bear does not move. <16:29 \u2014 16:31> A man is standing in a garden. He is constantly stung/bitten by a thick swarm of insects. A girl screams at him from nearby, ignored by the insects. The man looks at the girl, screams something back, and then reaches into his pocket. <16:31 \u2014 17:31> Red static. <17:31 \u2014 17:54> A bonfire. <17:54 \u2014 20:54> Grey. <20:54 \u2014 23:54> A girl repeatedly stabs a man lying on the ground with a sharpened femur.

        "SCP-3448 Day 9 Lab Notes Holy fuck. It worked. And then he\u2026 fuck I don't know what really happened. This entire past week has felt like I've been watching someone's acid trip. Ok, we still don't know what that girl is, but stabbing Tony means she's hostile, which means we need to do something. I called in a favor and got a handgun delivered here. Same procedure as with the lighter.",

They are surrounded by teddy bears, all of which are looking at the girl. <04:01 \u2014 04:03> A cocoon sits on a tree branch where all of the leaves are replaced with hands. The cocoon breaks open, and a moth exits. <05:00 \u2014 05:02> Same as the 03:01 \u2014 04:01 image, except the teddy bears are all grasping lighters with the flames exposed, and all of the garden is on fire.

        "SCP-3448 Day 10 Lab Notes Oh fuck. What even just. Shit. I don't think I've ever been so torn over one of my experiments working twice in a row. But still he\u2014 he shot her. I mean of course he would, we gave him the gun but I can't believe it. Like, I didn't actually think that was going to happen. Again, what else was going to happen? But just\u2026 FUCK Then like, five minutes later the calls started. First it was from Joyce talking about how her father wasn't dying. I'd told her to contact me if anything strange started happening with her family which might be related to Tony but this wasn't a calm informative call. She was just so excited panicked ecstatic terrified I don't fucking know. After that was the call from O5-4. Only council member that knew about our little project. Signed off on the funding and everything. He congratulated me on our success, and then told me to burn it all. That's probably when it sunk in. It really should've been apparent from the start. It was in our contracts, it's what we told people on their first day: \"This project has a single objective - contain the Dammerung Class cognitohazard known as death\". We did it? No, we really didn't do it. All those years of theorizing and studying the data, scouring anomalous burial sites and hauls from MTF raids. And finally, we come face to face with the reaper. And what do we do? We fucking shoot him her. Now all we have is a tombstone reading Rest In Peace: Resting in Peace. We fucked up. We didn't contain death. We neutralized it.",
