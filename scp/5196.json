    "all_text": "rating:\u00a0\n+37\n+\n\u2013\nx\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5196\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Provisional Site-62 has been established in the area where SCP-5196 was discovered. A minimum of two armed guards are to be stationed outside Provisional Site-62 at all times to detain and amnesticize civilians who attempt to enter.\n\n\nSCP-5196 is to be kept in a rectangular containment chamber with fortified walls. Access to SCP-5196's containment chamber is forbidden except for maintenance purposes and the removal of excess bottles following anomalous events.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5196 is a red fourth-generation Toyota Supra\n1\n. Despite presumably being abandoned for a significant period of time, SCP-5196 does not display any signs of structural damage or rust.\n\n\nApproximately every hour, a non-anomalous empty unlabeled glass bottle containing trace amounts of alcohol will spontaneously manifest in the air within a one meter radius of SCP-5196, an unidentified white male who appears to be in his twenties (henceforth SCP-5196-A) will manifest in the driver's seat, and SCP-5196 will start on its own. As SCP-5196 is starting, several more identical glass bottles will manifest around it.\n\n\nUpon starting, SCP-5196 will immediately begin accelerating with no input from SCP-5196-A, continuing until it collides with a hard surface. Upon coming to a complete stop following a collision with a surface, SCP-5196 will be spontaneously restored to its original state, and SCP-5196-A will demanifest. It is unclear if SCP-5196-A is conscious or aware of what is occurring during these events.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Discovery\n\n\nSCP-5196 was discovered following reports of a car repeatedly colliding with trees in a forest near the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ohio. Foundation personnel secured the location, Provisional Site-62 was established, and civilians who witnessed SCP-5196 were amnesticized. A journal containing only one legible entry was also found near SCP-5196. The author of this entry is unknown, but it is believed to contain a list of materials for a thaumaturgical ritual related to SCP-5196. A transcript of the entry follows.\n\n\n\n\nmaterials needed for ritual to get old days back:\n\n\n-car (have)\n\n\n-booze (have, do i need specific kind?)\n\n\n-diploma (couldn't find, will have to make due without)\n\n\nif this works, find them again.\n\n\n\n\nA photo album containing five photos was recovered alongside the journal, and the photos are described below:\n\n\n\n\nPhoto 1: Five unidentified men standing next to each other in front of a library in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
