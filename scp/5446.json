The object itself is contained in a secure item vault, and is only to be utilized by trained medical personnel located on-site.\n\n\nAll individuals recruited for Area-58 management or SCP-3932\n1\n recontainment efforts must consent to SCP-5446 application. Prior to this, they are to be supplied with scuba gear so they are able to navigate the facility without drowning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea-58 Director Gabriel Himes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5446 is a metallic amulet, believed to have been produced around six thousand years ago.\n\n\nWhen applied to a human subject submerged in salt water, the anomaly converts them into an SCP-5446-\u0394 instance. These are sapient, telepathic jellyfish, superficially similar to the lion's mane jellyfish (\nCyanea capillata\n), with tentacles ranging from 24 to 31 meters in length. Individuals transformed this way retain their intelligence and memories, and are able to make use of electric thaumaturgy for combat, communication, and interfacing with Area-58's computer systems.\n\n\nOriginally SCP-5446 was held in a Site-19 locker before being requisitioned to produce sea-based security personnel who would be capable of directly attacking \nSCP-3932-\u0394\n instances. Previous efforts involving specialized diving equipment proved too expensive and cumbersome, as SCP-3932-\u0394 instances would easily outmaneuver personnel or sabotage their oxygen tanks.\n\n\nAddendum 5446-1:\n Deployment History\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nOperational Update\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/03/01\n\n\nThree volunteers become SCP-5446-\u0394 instances and trial electricity-based combat.\n\n\nPersonnel are able to fend off SCP-3932 instances in containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/03/17\n\n\nProtocol for SCP-5446 transformation ratified by the O5 Council.\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/04/09\n\n\nFirst squadron of SCP-5446-\u0394 instances deployed in the Solomon Sea.\n\n\nLarge amount of territory reclaimed from the The Great Barrier Reef Empire-In-Exile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/09/15\n\n\nTrials of SCP-5446-\u0394 combat augments begins.\n\n\nMostly successful, some issues with electric arc redirection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018/12/03\n\n\nFoundation Navy leads a joint attack from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, utilizing experimental sonar technology.\n\n\nA large number of SCP-3932-\u0394 are contained or terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019/03/19\n\n\nStaffing and funding of Area-58 increased significantly.\n\n\nSeveral decisive victories follow. The Dolphin's Posadist Republic of Indonesia begins limiting military activity near Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019/07/08\n\n\nMark IV underseas surveillance equipment is developed.\n\n\nHostile SCP-3932-\u0394 activity has diminished. Foundation priorities shift towards information control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019/11/04\n\n\nA regular SCP-5446-\u0394 patrol returns with significant casualties, reporting that the dolphins are utilizing thaumaturgic runes which limit the effectiveness of electric attacks.\n\n\nInvestigation into possible countermeasures begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020/02/27\n\n\nActive recruitment and training of SCP-5446-\u0394 personnel resumes.\n\n\nFoundation forces have begun to lose ground. SCP-3932-\u0394 instances are reported as being equipped with suits capable of thaumaturgic deflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020/07/10\n\n\nSix months has passed without a major Foundation victory.\n\n\nMorale has fallen significantly. SCP-3932-\u0394 appear to possess advanced undersea paraweaponry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020/09/21\n\n\nThe Foundation Navy, in conjunction with the \nUS Navy\n and Royal Australian Navy, are tasked with leading any new military containment operations involving SCP-3932.\n\n\nFighting enters a lull where controlled territory does not significantly change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020/10/18\n\n\nA surprise attack by SCP-3932-\u0394 instances is launched on Site-\u2588\u2588, though is successfully fended off.\n\n\nHow dolphin forces discovered the location of the site is under investigation. Witness testimony suggests a large number of unidentified jellyfish were present at the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5446-2:\n Containment Update\n\n\nOn 2021/01/02 around 03:15 AM local time, an insurgent cell of Area-58 personnel staged an attack on the facility. Utilizing their anomalous capabilities, they debilitated loyal personnel via psychic assault, and unsealed Area-58's primary entrance to the open sea.\n\n\nA large number of hostile SCP-3932-\u0394 and SCP-5446-\u0394 instances then swarmed the facility. The dolphin combatants deployed previously-unseen paraweaponry capable of shrinking personnel, permitting them to be consumed.\n2\n The operatives then opened SCP-5446's containment chamber and breached the anomaly. To date, it has not yet been recovered.\n\n\nAll Foundation facilities have been informed to be on alert for attacks by Chaos Insurgency agents who are telepathic jellyfish.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. A memetic anomaly which bestows sapience upon dolphins who hear it. SCP-3932-\u0394 instances have organized into three nation-states, all of which are at war with the Foundation. For more information, see its full SCP file.\n\n\n2\n.
