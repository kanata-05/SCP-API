Any civilian air-transport is to be delayed to keep planes out of its flight-path. Additionally, several smaller communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Gabon and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have been relocated to minimize the chances of exposure or lethal injury. Contact with living creatures is to be avoided at all times. Slabs of soil of at least 200\u00a0kg are placed at a height of at least 20 meters or highest point of construction in high-density population centers to reduce risk of collision.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3958 is a miniature replica of planet Earth, approximately 38\u00a0mm in diameter. SCP-3958 is spatially locked above the ground with respect to the Sun, such that it always remains on the night side of the Earth underneath the L2 Lagrange point. To maintain this spatial orientation, SCP-3958 moves at a speed of 1656 kph relative to a terrestrial observer, and hovers at altitudes between 1.5 and 2860 meters above sea level.\n1\n\n\nRegardless of its height, SCP-3958 will never come within 1.5 meters of terrain (defined here as untreated soil with a mass of at least 150\u00a0kg).\n\n\nNo methods of arresting SCP-3958's movement have been found; it invariably penetrates all inanimate materials that it contacts without losing speed. Further testing on inorganic matter has been suspended after the impact with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 caused rapid heating and expansion, resulting in the injury of Foundation personnel. Any living organic being possessing a mass of 25\u00a0kg or higher that comes into contact with SCP-3958 will gain its anomalous properties until contact is broken. This has so far universally resulted in the subject's expiration due to rapid deceleration and impact with the environment.\n\n\nAddendum: SCP-3958 Discovery Log\n SCP-3958 came to the attention of the SCP Foundation at [REDACTED] on Oct \u2588\u2588, 1962. Due to Foundation resources invested in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 governments, damage done by SCP-3958 to the ships \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was quickly reported to the Foundation. Damage was explained to both parties by Foundation personnel as ammunition malfunctions.\n\n\nFurther analysis of the event and reconstruction of path of damage resulted in the calculation of SCP-3958's trajectory and its next position was successfully predicted and caught on satellite image.\n\n\nThree research stations were established in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, to record SCP-3958's momentum and anomalous properties. At the time, these were the only three instances of SCP-3958 moving close enough to non-populated areas for testing.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum:\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a0A\u00a0-\u00a0Date:\u00a0\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1966\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest conducted at research station D\u00ecqi\u00fa Beta in the South China sea.\n\n\nTests equipment:\n\n\n\n\nTwo panels of rice paper, ten meters apart, for speed measurements.\n\n\nThree panes of solid steel, thickness of ten cm, one meter and three meters.\n\n\nOne block of soil, fifty cm thick, encased in glass of five cm thickness.\n\n\nFive 35\u00a0mm rotating prism cameras.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3958 was correctly projected to arrive at 0254 HKT at an altitude of 12 meters. Measurements made of the object upon perforation of paper testing sheets indicate a speed upwards of 1500 kilometers per hour.\n\n\nRecovered camera footage shows that SCP-3958 showed no visible signs of slowing down upon contact with the steel panes. The rapid displacement of the steel plates caused the destruction of the block of soil and injured two Foundation researchers.\n\n\nTesting on solid matter with tensile strength exceeding 150\u00a0MPa is prohibited until further notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Addendum:\u00a0Test\u00a0Log\u00a0B\u00a0-\u00a0Date:\u00a0\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1969\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Addendum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest conducted at research station Dharatee 2 in the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\nTest equipment:\n\n\n\n\nTwo panels of rice paper, ten meters apart, for speed measurements.\n\n\nOne block of soil, fifty cm thick, encased in glass of five cm thickness.\n\n\nOne Osmanabadi Goat.\n\n\nTen 70\u00a0mm rotating prism cameras.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3958 was projected to arrive at 0110 IST at an altitude of 45 meters.

    "containment_procedures": "SCP-3958 is currently not contained. Any civilian air-transport is to be delayed to keep planes out of its flight-path. Additionally, several smaller communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Gabon and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have been relocated to minimize the chances of exposure or lethal injury. Contact with living creatures is to be avoided at all times. Slabs of soil of at least 200\u00a0kg are placed at a height of at least 20 meters or highest point of construction in high-density population centers to reduce risk of collision.",
    "description": "SCP-3958 is a miniature replica of planet Earth, approximately 38\u00a0mm in diameter. SCP-3958 is spatially locked above the ground with respect to the Sun, such that it always remains on the night side of the Earth underneath the L2 Lagrange point. To maintain this spatial orientation, SCP-3958 moves at a speed of 1656 kph relative to a terrestrial observer, and hovers at altitudes between 1.5 and 2860 meters above sea level.1",
