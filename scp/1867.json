There are no physical differences between SCP-1867 and any other member of its species.\n\n\nSCP-1867 is sapient and capable of telepathic communication with the same range as a typical human voice. It identifies itself as \u201cLord Theodore Thomas Blackwood\u201d, a British explorer and naturalist, and speaks with terminology and style appropriate to late nineteenth century England. It is generally friendly and cooperative with researchers.\n\n\nSCP-1867 makes repeated claims of past exploits and accomplishments, including service in the Second Opium War, expeditions to remote regions of the world, and encounters with various rare creatures and uncontacted peoples. Despite the questionable validity of many of its claims, SCP-1867 has shown in-depth knowledge of geography, zoology, botany, archaeology, anthropology and linguistics relating to its claimed regions of exploration, as well as more esoteric fields such as obscure mythology, mysticism, and cryptozoology. SCP-1867 does not seem to realize, or willfully ignores, any inconsistencies in its own recollections as well as any events or information dating after approximately 1910.\n\n\nWhen requested to give proof of its exploits, SCP-1867 provided an address near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, England, claiming that it would be \u201cmore than willing to donate [its] collection.\u201d Investigation of the address led to a cottage owned by one Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who claimed to be \u201ckeeping the house for Lord Blackwood\u201d. Further questioning failed to reveal any details of SCP-1867\u2019s nature or origins beyond what information SCP-1867 had already provided. Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 died of heart failure five days after Foundation agents began investigations.\n\n\nInvestigation of the cottage revealed an underground vault containing over three thousand artifacts, zoological and botanical specimens, a library containing over five thousand items, and a functioning, if outdated, laboratory. All materials within the collection were cataloged, removed and relocated by the Foundation over the course of three weeks.\n\n\nAddendum-01:\n A full listing of items recovered from SCP-1867\u2019s collection may be found in Document 1867-VL. A summary of noteworthy items is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n116 unknown species of plants\n\n\n107 unknown species of insects\n\n\n28 unknown species of lizards\n\n\n23 unknown species of fish\n\n\n14 unknown species of amphibians\n\n\n12 unknown species of mammals\n\n\nFossils pertaining to 8 unknown species of dinosaur\n\n\nFossils pertaining to 12 unknown species of prehistoric mammal\n\n\nArtifacts belonging to 29 unknown indigenous cultures\n\n\n35 hand-written journals containing recordings of events described by SCP-1867: written accounts match with verbal, save variations and exaggerations on the part of SCP-1867 in re-telling, and have been dated to the appropriate time period of the events described.\n\n\n20 kilograms of processed opium\n\n\nCollection of firearms of make and model not correlating with any known manufacturers, including three wide-bore muskets marked as \u201cDr. B. T. Moth\u2019s Effective Particle Destabilizers.\u201d These items are non-functional.\n\n\nDetailed globes of Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Galilean moons, accompanied by notes detailing possible paths of surface exploration.\n\n\nA heavily modified four-seat horse carriage, containing instruments of unknown purpose. A note attached to the door reads \n\u201cOn the fritz. Speak with Henry\u201d\n in handwriting matching that of the journals.\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED] \u2013 Four agents were killed after activation before the object was destroyed. When questioned about the item, SCP-1867\u2019s response was \u201cI did warn you to be careful around my collection. That bloody thing nearly took my head off in Woking back in ninety-seven when I found it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-02:\n\n\nThe following interview is dated \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2012\n\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Good morning, Lord Blackwood.\n\n\nSCP-1867: Ah, good morning Doctor! Wonderful to see you. Come in, come in, have yourself a seat. Now if I remember correctly, the last time you were here I was telling you about the time I was captured by the Ubula tribe of the Congo\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Actually, I have some questions about that story, today. Our research turned up no trace of that people. They don\u2019t seem to exist.\n\n\nSCP-1867: Of course not! There weren\u2019t any of the Ubula left after the village was attacked by Mok\u00e8l\u00e9-mb\u00e8mb\u00e9. I still regret not being able to bag that monster when I had the chance. It is a persistently elusive creature\u2026\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Hm. That\u2019s a stretch, sir. Do you have any corroborating evidence? Just to make sure what you\u2019re saying is true. There\u2019s always a chance that your vault was filled with fakes.\n\n\nSCP-1867: Nonsense! I would never fabricate any of my work. Why, it\u2019s against the very heart of being a naturalist! While I am repeatedly amazed by your institution here, you seem to be missing the explorer\u2019s spirit. When I scaled the Himalayas in search of the Monks of the Golden Mountain, did I worry about what others had said about them? Of course not! I went and found out for myself! Climbed those mountains with my own two hands!\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: [short pause] You do realize that you\u2019re a sea slug, right?\n\n\nSCP-1867: Good heavens, boy, have you been drinking? That\u2019s utterly ridiculous. If you can\u2019t be bothered to be sensible I have no reason to speak with you. Go get yourself a nice cup of tea and sober up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1866\n | SCP-1867 | \nSCP-1868\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1867\n\" by Djoric, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
