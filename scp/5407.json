Members are to be considered dangerous, and on-sight termination has been approved whenever necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5407 sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5407 is a biological substance used as a recreational drug known as Nectar (\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440). Though the exact method used is unknown, SCP-5407 is manufactured using a complex carnomantic ritual. Individuals under the influence of SCP-5407 experience an effect similar to that generated by heroin and other Class 3 opiates, including intense euphoria, lethargy, and disorientation. These effects are more potent and have a longer duration when compared to standard opiates. SCP-5407 remains within the user's blood for approximately five days, though trace amounts of inert materials are stored within fat cells. Withdrawal symptoms will begin to develop after approximately six days of use discontinuation.\n\n\nWithdrawal from SCP-5407 develops in four stages, which are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject in Stage Two of SCP-5407 withdrawal.\n\n\n\n\nStage One\n: A rash similar in appearance to atopic dermatitis\n2\n will spread over 95% of the body.\n\n\nStage Two\n: Areas of the body affected by rash will develop necrosis.\n\n\nStage Three\n: Large fleshy protrusions will form randomly throughout the body.\n\n\nStage Four\n: Systemic organ failure, followed by death.\n\n\nAside from reintroducing SCP-5407 to the individual's system, there is no known method of counteracting withdrawal symptoms once infected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nOn 2019/08/23, the Alaskan branch of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) apprehended Milo Igorvich for possession of 25\u00a0kg of SCP-5407, which they mistook for heroin. The following video was sent to the Foundation by assets within the DEA:\n\n\n\n\n\u274f\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0\u274f\n\n\n\n\n\u2750\u00a0Video\u00a0Log\u00a0\u2750\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 2019/08/25\n\n\nInterviewer:\n DEA Special Agent Kyle White\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Milo Igorvich\n\n\nLocation:\n DEA field office, Nome Alaska.\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n[Agent White and Milo Igorvich are sitting at a metal table; Mr. Igorvich is restrained to the chair via handcuffs.]\n\n\nAgent White:\n Okay, Mr. Igorvich, let's get down to it.

No trace of SCP-5407 or the three assailants were found.\n\n\nFollowing this incident, the Foundation began a full investigation into a possible GoI-0432 cell operating within Alaska. MTF Gamma-44 was dispatched to lead the investigation, in conjunction with a special task force of the DEA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation Dust-Bust\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoI-0432's Alaskan compound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation into GoI-0432 activities within Alaska revealed a substantial drug distribution network in the cities of Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and Seattle. MTF Gamma-44 traced the operation to a compound located 2\u00a0km outside of Cordova, Alaska.\n\nOn 2019/10/16, Operation Dust-Bust began, with the explicit goal of raiding the GoI-0432 compound and dismantling their operation. At 05:00 GMT, a Joint Task Force consisting of MTF Gamma-44, MTF Xi-8 (\"The Last to Fall\"), and Mobile Strike Force Bravo-5 (\"Deaf Hand\") initiated the operation. Over the next seven hours, the JTF apprehended 14 GoI-0432 operatives and terminated an additional 28, while enduring a total of 18 casualties of their own. At 13:30 GMT, the compound was fully under Foundation control and the operation was declared successful.\n\n\nDuring the subsequent investigation of the compound, the sublevel responsible for the production of SCP-5407 was discovered.

The arm rapidly detracts, leaving a gaping hole in the Agent's neck.

Borov has been contained. Wait at your location.\n\n\nChandler:\n Understood.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation Dust-Bust yielded approximately 2.5 metric tons of SCP-5407, 12 anomalous items, 200 million dollars, and over 100 documents and non-anomalous artifacts related to Sarkicism. All detained GoI-0432 members, including the cell's leader Mikkel Borov (POI-R606/1), have been relocated to Site-51. The bodies used to create SCP-5407 were cut from the ceiling, thoroughly examined, and incinerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report\n\n\nOn 2019/10/23, the Foundation flagged reports of nearly 3,000 SCP-5407 withdrawal-related deaths, in Alaska and Washington state. Further investigation led to the discovery of an additional 4,000 victims displaying early withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\nAn interrogation was conducted on POI-R606/1, who was sealed in a biological containment unit. The following is an audio transcript of the interrogation:\n\n\n\n\n\u274f\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0\u274f\n\n\n\n\n\u2750\u00a0Audio\u00a0Log\u00a0\u2750\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOI-R606/1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDate:\n 2019/10/24\n\n\nInterrogator:\n Interrogation Specialist Frederick Night\n\n\nInterrogee:\n POI-R606/1 - Mikkel Borov\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nR606/1:\n So, the flies start falling and the Jailors come calling? \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435. (\nLucky me.\n)\n\n\nNight:\n Yes, lucky you, let get this over with, Borov. How do we stop the withdrawals?\n\n\nR606/1:\n \n[Snickering.]\n Well, that's pretty easy, they need the \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440. Or, you could just release me and I ensure you the withdrawals will stop.\n\n\nNight:\n Oh? That does sound pretty simple. Unfortunately for you, that's not an option, Borov, and you know it.\n\n\nR606/1:\n Here's what \nI\n know, Jailor: you have no choice in the matter. You think you've put a stop to this\u2013 but you've barely scratched the surface.\n\n\nNight:\n Empty threats and misdirection isn't going to get you out of this cell. You might as well cut the shit.\n\n\nR606/1:\n You really understand nothing, you think you hold all the cards, that you have things figured out? Laughable ignorance; but such is expected from the likes of the koljatmert\u00e4 (\nUnclean\n).\n\n\nNight:\n Then enlighten me, Borov, what's the big plan?\n\n\nR606/1:\n You have a total of six people in this facility currently under the influence of my \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440, correct?\n\n\nNight:\n How do\u2013\n\n\n[R606/1 snaps his fingers.]\n\n\nR606/1:\n Why don't you see how many you have, now.\n\n\n[Specialist Night's radio crackles.]\n\n\nSecurity Officer:\n W-we've got a problem!

So, how about we talk about my release?\n\n\nNight:\n You killing a few D-Class isn't getting you out of\u2013\n\n\nR606/1:\n No, no, you still aren't seeing the big picture. By my calculations, we have about 200,000 customers on the West Coast alone. Each one forever bound to me. So, how about we paint the streets red?\n\n\nNight:\n Y-you wouldn't, that wou\u2013\n\n\nR606/1:\n You think this is bluff? So be it,\n\n\nNight:\n No, no, no wait!\n\n\nR606/1:\n Yes?\n\n\nNight:\n What are your demands?\n\n\nR606/1:\n As I said, release me\u2013 now.\n\n\nNight:\n And what of your subordinates, you can't expect us\u2013\n\n\nR606/1:\n Keep them. I have no use for fools incapable of stopping the likes of you.\n\n\nNight:\n I don't have the authority to make any deal with you. I'll have to speak to my supervisor.\n\n\nR606/1:\n Better hurry, we wouldn't want any more fallen flies, would we?\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this interrogation, the Foundation approved POI-R606/1's immediate termination. Utilizing Flash Fire Protocols, POI-R606/1 was instantly incinerated on a cellular level while in his cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInert SCP-5407 Sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately two minutes after the termination, the Foundation's supply of SCP-5407 underwent a rapid structural change, turning the substance black. Testing showed that SCP-5407 had lost its anomalous properties and became inert, though trace amounts of a previously unidentified bacterium were found.\n\n\nIn the weeks following this incident, over 120,000 civilians on the Western Coast of the United States were diagnosed with Septicemic plague. The infected individuals were all exposed to SCP-5407 prior to infection. The Foundation, in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and DEA enacted Cover Story P67Y (Infectious Disease Outbreak). A joint CDC/DEA press conference was held claiming a large shipment of the drug heroin had been tainted by the \nYersinia pestis\n bacterium, which led to the subsequent plague outbreak among drug users.\n\n\nTo maintain normalcy, the Foundation is providing the CDC with substantial support in order to treat as many SCP-5407 victims as possible. Current death toll estimations are approximately 40,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct II: \nExierunt ut Vinceret\n | \nIn Memoria, Adytum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
