During observation periods, hallways may be open for use in navigation tests, following and preceding decontamination of floors and walls, but all doors must remain locked, and all unrelated staff must evacuate any rooms or corridors potentially being used by SCP-5328.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-5328\u2019s affliction does not appear to be directly transmittable, the villages of Faro and Norman Wells must be covertly monitored in the event that a second instance manifests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5328 shortly after acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5328 is the corpse of an Inuit woman, initially discovered partly frozen in Yukon Territory, 30\u00a0km from the village of Faro. Judging by the bodily anatomy, the subject appears to have been 7-8 months pregnant at time of death, however, surgical investigation has revealed no presence of fetal tissue or fetal remains.\n\n\nSCP-5328 is bisected in a jagged pattern approximately 6\u00a0cm below the naval. Appearance of the torn flesh suggests that the subject was forcibly ripped in half by a pulling or stretching motion, rather than being cut with any type of incision. There are no scars or markings on the limbs or head to indicate that the bisection was made by an external force.\n\n\nCellular analysis of the top half of the body, including head, arms, and upper torso, reveals no living tissue of any form. MRI scans and surgical analysis have shown that all internal organs are mostly intact, save for the colon and the enlarged uterus, which are torn along the margin of bisection. MRI scans reveal that the brain is 0.32\u00a0kg lighter than what would be considered normal for a human of the subject\u2019s body type. The loss in mass comes primarily from shrunken portions in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and hippocampus.\n\n\nAnalysis of the corpse's lower half reveals an abnormally large quantity of overactive nervous tissue ostensibly overtaking and controlling the dead muscular tissue. While thawed, the neurons present throughout SCP-5328 undergo rapid growth, slowly consuming the dead tissue, primarily in the bones. These use strong electrical charges to manipulate the muscles into convulsive contraction and retraction. The neurons will repair or replace the torn muscles at a rapid pace, but the bones and ligaments continue to degrade, often breaking or dislocating. Though its movements are often erratic, SCP-5328 is capable of notable feats of navigation, as it was able to travel several kilometers through the snow in Yukon territory towards Faro, where it was first reported, then return to its top half, where the Foundation first made acquisition (see Addendum 5328-A for further examples).\n\n\nDNA analysis reveals that the active neurons are human cells and are a match to DNA taken from both halves of the corpse. Since they consume mostly non-muscular flesh, tests have been performed to determine if they behave similarly to flesh eating bacteria. Samples were applied, in order, to dead human tissue from volunteers, live tissue from animals, including rats and geckos, and live tissue from two class-D personnel. In all instances, the neuron samples died after a period of six hours, while the test subjects remained unchanged. The current hypothesis is that this nervous tissue only consumes flesh with matching DNA, which it converts into electricity.\n\n\nBecause SCP-5328\u2019s life depends on the presence of its own tissue to consume, its lifespan is extremely short; estimated to be approximately two months of cumulative time spent unfrozen, starting at the time this file is written. It is estimated that enough tissue will have been consumed in the first cumulative month that it will effectively deflate in shape and its motion will be hindered beyond function. Therefore, SCP-5328 must remain frozen in order to drastically slow the rate of decomposition, and any time spent studying SCP-5328 when thawed must be greatly limited in order to preserve the specimen for as long as possible.\n\n\nAddendum 5328-A:\n Third observation session audio recording\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0transcript\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Dr. Alistair Bosco, I\u2019m making an audio recording of this observation session with\u2014\n\n\n[Metallic banging can be heard from inside the freezer unit]\n\n\nUm, with SCP-5328, as the last two sessions have been, ah, rather eventful. It moves relatively quickly so I\u2019d like to record my thoughts at each moment before I make a write-up. As you can likely hear, the temperature in the freezer has been increased to fifteen degrees Celcius, so the specimen is thawed at this point, and it\u2019s already active. I am now opening the door and letting it out.\n\n\n[Dr. Bosco can be heard unlatching the locks on the freezer and opening the door]\n\n\nCome on out now. Come on. You were so active just a minute ago, why aren\u2019t you moving? Come on.\n\n\n[There is a rapid skittering noise, a brief silence, then a crack]\n\n\nOh, um, so the first thing it did after exiting the freezer was to bend, or, hyperextend its left knee. It came out very quickly, like it wasn\u2019t just frozen for days. I\u2019m\u2014It\u2019s now trying to turn itself over. I can\u2019t tell if\u2014 Wait.\n\n\n[More light cracking can be heard, followed by a thud]\n\n\nMy god, is it trying to stand up? This hasn\u2019t happened before, normally it just crawls but this time it actually pushed itself up with both feet, one of which is bent to face the opposite direction, and tried to stabilize itself. If there are portions of the hippocampus still alive in there, maybe it\u2019s remembering how to walk. It\u2019s almost like a toddler learning to walk and falling on its behind, which is\u2014 Oh!\n\n\n[Dr. Bosco is heard jumping out of the way as SCP-5328 crawls past him]\n\n\nOkay, it\u2019s moving into walls, trying to crawl up them. It\u2019s now crawling across the floor to the west wall. This is what I was expecting. It\u2019s\u2026 Yes, it moved to the doorway and is kicking at the door. I\u2019m not sure if it understands what a doorknob is. It\u2019s hard to believe it can understand anything at all, but somehow in both of my last sessions, it tried to exit through the west door. I\u2019ve already evacuated the hallways and had them disinfected in preparation for this. I\u2019m going to\u2014\n\n\n[A clap is heard]\n\n\nOw, stop that! Ow, ow, stop, stop, get off, jeez! Ha, um, it can\u2019t hear me but, uh, but I\u2019m opening the door now. Okay, it\u2019s attempting to navigate, or rather, what I currently hypothesize is navigating, through the halls. It\u2019s mostly just brushing up against the walls and crashing into it blindly. It seems to be trying to climb up one of them, but it\u2019s just falling over.\n\n\n[A crack is heard]\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s breaking its right tibia and fibula to bend itself to reach the ground with its foot. I doubt that will heal since it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it do that. This worries me if it continues to break its own bones. Soon there\u2019ll be nothing left of it. It\u2019s moving along the hallway now. Looks like it got its bearings. It\u2019s at the north exit door. It\u2019s banging on it like it did with the lab door. I wonder if it knows that that\u2019s the exit leading outside. Maybe it feels the air coming from outside. Um, I can\u2019t let it out, but it seems insistent that it be released through this door. Maybe it\u2019s trying to migrate north, as strange as it\u2014Whoa!\n\n\n[Rapid skittering is heard increasing in volume, then decreasing as Dr. Bosco jumps against a wall]\n\n\nThat\u2019s the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen it move, with a broken leg hanging off of it, no less. It\u2019s apparently done trying to escape. Hold on. Okay, I\u2019m back at the lab entrance. It made its way back shockingly quickly and has entered its freezer unit. This is how it usually ends our sessions; it crawls back into the container and aligns itself with its top half, sort of like a puzzle piece. So now it\u2019s lying still, like it\u2019s pretending to be a single body that hasn\u2019t been torn in half. It \nknows\n that the rest of its body is there. I still can\u2019t quite explain it, but given how damaged it\u2019s becoming, I worry it won\u2019t be much longer before the bones are essentially nonexistent and it ends up wriggling like a worm. It\u2019s done for the day, I won\u2019t force it to stay out.\n\n\n[Dr. Bosco can be heard crouching and placing his hands on the freezer door]\n\n\nWait, did it just\u2026 Hang on, I\u2019m going to look more closely. I probably shouldn\u2019t be sticking my head in here, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll harm me\u2026 It\u2026 No, never mind. I thought I saw the arm move. Maybe the legs just moved and blocked the light shining on it.\n\n\n[Dr. Bosco can be heard locking the freezer]\n\n\nThat was a quick session but I\u2019ve gathered a little more information. It definitely has a desire to escape the facility. I\u2019m not sure why, but I fear with its short lifespan and the impossibility of allowing it to leave the facility that we may never find out. I\u2019m keeping it frozen for as long as I can. I think some other hypothesis needs to be made regarding what\u2019s causing these phenomena before we can risk any further tests on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5328-B:\n\nAfter Dr. Bosco\u2019s audio recording was submitted, several researchers pointed out the presence of an indiscriminate noise that occurred at the 4:57 mark as he closed the door to the freezer at the end of the session. Most speculated the sound was a vocalization made by SCP-5328, possibly as a result of the legs transferring neurons to the mouth and vocal cords via physical connection. Dr. Bosco claimed he did not hear this during the observation session, but turned off SCP-5328\u2019s freezer unit and installed an audio recorder in case any similar noises were made. The following audio clips were recorded over the course of two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n1/15/21\u00a04:54 PM:\n\n\n\n\n1/19/21\u00a05:20 AM:\n\n\n\n\n1/20/21\u00a012:58 AM:\n\n\n\n\n1/24/21\u00a07:02 PM:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5328 regurgitated part of its larynx during the final clip. No subsequent vocalizations occurred.\n\nAddendum 5328-C:\n\nIn an attempt to identify the corpse, inquiries have been made about missing person reports in Alaska and the Canadian territories. The only report found that nearly matches SCP-5328 originates from Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, over 400\u00a0km from where SCP-5328 was acquired. The report was made five days after the acquisition of SCP-5328, by the father of 30-year-old Lana Qarpik, when her vehicle, rented from Yellowknife Airport, was discovered abandoned 100\u00a0km from the border of British Columbia. Files were confiscated from the local medical office and Lana Qarpik\u2019s home in hopes confirming SCP-5328\u2019s identity and determining the cause of its affliction.\n\n\nUltrasound files for Lana Qarpik during pregnancy\n\n\n\n\nDate: 8/3/20\n\nGestational age: ~15 wks\n\nSex: unidentified\n\nCardiac activity: present\n\nStructures visualized: skull, neck, heart, spine\n\nHead circumference: 126\u00a0mm\n\nVisit summary:\n\nAll readings normal.\n\nPatient is under high distress, claiming she has been abstinent for several years.

Although the quantity of living cells present has not changed, its movement has become noticeably sluggish, and it is unable to stand or reach upwards more than 50\u00a0cm. Moving forward, we will be using cryogenics to preserve SCP-5328. It may only be released if new regenerative technology is developed for it or another separate instance is discovered.\n\n\nTo the junior researchers involved with this specimen, especially those for whom this was their first project, first of all, yes, this will likely take a matter of years. Second, any further appeals by staff to satisfy SCP-5328's alleged requests made in Addendum 5328-B will continue to be ignored. The Foundation's living specimens are not pets, and you will need to learn this the hard way if you want to continue to work here. \"What harm would it do?\" is not a valid question. Be aware that this is neither an act of mercy nor cruelty. Anyone who insults me again by referring to this as the latter will be recommended for a project with a high risk rating so that you will better understand why we are doing this.\n\n\n\n\n-Dr. Alistair Bosco\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident I-5328-1:\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 5/21/21\n\n\nLocation:\n Site 17- West entrance\n\n\nCasualties:\n 1\n\n\nDescription:\n\nAt 3:15 AM, an intruder was detected climbing the outer fence at the facility's west gate. The intruder ignored warnings by security to stop and was gunned down after successfully entering the nine digit passcode to open the west entrance door. The intruder was identified as George Qarpik, 63, of Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, Canada.\n\n\nBecause of the intruder's speculated relation to SCP-5328, his remains were given to Dr. Alistair Bosco for DNA sampling before incineration. Dr. Bosco has confirmed that the man was related by blood to SCP-5328.\n\n\nDue to the clear connection between the intruder and an SCP, plus his knowledge of the entrance passcode, the Foundation is thoroughly investigating all staff members who have been involved with SCP-5328 for an intentional information leak. Any staff members with knowledge that may help the investigation are asked to report to upper management.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5328-E:\n\n\n\n\nThe current state of SCP-5328 research\n\n\n7/2/21\n\n\nDue to the recent happenings in regards to SCP-5328, which I'm sure you all have no doubt are related to incident I-5328-1, it is imperative that I share my recent findings with the senior staff involved. Since the information leak from the incident was almost certainly caused by a junior researcher with an unfortunate bleeding heart, who is yet to be identified, I will not be copying any of them on this information, and I recommend anyone reading this message also withhold it from them.\n\n\nFrankly, the appearance of the father of SCP-5328's former self is a blessing in disguise. Thanks to those in upper management who allowed me permission to dissect the corpse, my genetics team and I have isolated at least two abnormally mutated gene strings that both SCP-5328 and its parent possess. Although research is ongoing, they appear to be related to reproductive function and brain function, respectively. This all but confirms that the affliction is hereditary, and not caused by a contagion, as some of us feared. Thus, unless George Qarpik had other offspring that we don't know about (I suggest we make the necessary inquiries to be certain), Lana Qarpik, who we know as SCP-5328, was the only person affected.\n\n\nThis brings about my main hypothesis that I'd like to share, as I believe it may interest some particularly high ranking researchers. SCP-5328 is not a fluke of nature, but rather an unfathomably rare step in evolution, albeit a flawed one. Had Lana given birth, and not died in the Yukon wilderness, forcing the fetus to devour itself to stay alive, we may have seen the first instance of complete transferal of a person's consciousness to a separate body via natural means. This singular human was genetically designed to shift all of her knowledge and memories to an infantile duplicate of herself, for a potentially indefinite number of generations, effectively making her immortal. If properly harnessed, this genetic pattern could allow a person to keep their knowledge alive for longer than anyone has ever lived.\n\n\nThis is certainly a controversial hypothesis for a potential result that would be even more contentious within the science world, but I hope you all understand the importance of keeping SCP-5328 alive, and agree that this creature deserves to be studied further. Obviously, this research would have to be prevented from falling into the wrong hands, so I highly recommend raising the clearance level to at least 3, depending on our future findings.\n\n\nThank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing back from all of you.\n\n\n\n\n-Dr. Alistair Bosco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Prior containment procedures required only a standard freezer unit, as SCP-5328 can survive extremely low temperatures.
