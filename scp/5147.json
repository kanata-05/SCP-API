Inactive instances are permitted clothing but work equipment or utensils on their person are prohibited. All confiscated tools are to be stored in designated storage units. The entrance to the containment chamber with inactive instances is to be guarded by three guards at all times. Personnel with Level 2 Clearance or higher are permitted access to these instances.\n\n\nActive instances of SCP-5147 do not intend to breach containment. Instances may roam the premises of Site-06-3 freely after being equipped with an electronic ankle band with a GPS tracker. A guard may be assigned to an active instance at the discretion of Dr. Roy Hiveldyll.\n\n\nAny task or request given to SCP-5147's instances may not interfere with the Foundation, security risks, and other anomalies who are not classified as Safe. Any violation without explicit permission from senior staff results in being permanently blacklisted from SCP-5147.\n\n\nContainment of injured or broken instances needs to be observed by security cameras. If there has not been a visual recovery for 72 hours, the footage is considered outdated and subsequently deleted. Newly broken or recovered instances must be reported immediately. Injuring instances deliberately will also result in being blacklisted and possible termination.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5147 is the collective designation for 41 sentient hollow faceless mannequins (numbered SCP-5147-01 to -41). Each instance excels at a particular skill set, ranging from one particular skill to multiple, as long as they are closely related. Instances refer to each other with names associated with their respective skill sets (for example \"The Cook\") and refer to their collective as \"The Mannequin Troupe\".\n\n\nInstances are capable of receiving spoken and written requests. Upon acceptance, the individual instance will attempt to complete or provide aid in someone's request in a harmless manner. Requests that are morally unjust or are impossible to fulfill cannot be accepted. Requests are likely to be denied if the person seeking aid has harmed any instances in the past. Upon completion of a request, instances will return to their respective showcases and remain frozen in place resembling standard, non-anomalous mannequins.\n\n\nInstances are capable of regenerating after approximately 72 hours regardless of the severity of their injury. Instances do not like requests where they can get hurt easily and will ask for precautionary measures before resuming their original task.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-5147 was initially recovered on 24/6/2013, from a storage room of an abandoned theater in Krazow, Poland where they were used as stage-props and fitting dolls. Their anomalous properties were discovered during the soft strip of the theater when a demolition crew employee made a comment interpreted as a request.\n\n\n\n\nQuote: \n\"Maybe they can lend us a hand with this stuff, we'll be done in no time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKrazow's theater before going bankrupt and being abandoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this, several instances became active and began to assist in the soft strip of the building. One employee attempted to contact authorities twice. This lead to Foundation agents being dispatched. Class-B amnestics were administered to all involved witnesses following the removal of SCP-5147. The theater was subsequently demolished to make place for a new residential area.\n\n\nInstances did not resist during initial recovery. SCP-5147 was temporarily relocated to the nearest site before permanently being moved to \nHumanoid Containment Site-06-3\n in France.\n\n\nInterview after discovery\n\n\n\n\nAudio\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a027/06/2013\n\n\n\n\nAudio\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\u00a027/06/2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n SCP-5147-32 \"The Vocalist\"\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Roy Hiveldyll\n\n\nForeword:\n The interview took place 3 days after the initial discovery. SCP-5147 had yet to be transferred to the Humanoid Containment Site-06-3.\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Good afternoon SCP-5147-32. I'm Doctor Hiveldyll. You can simply call me Doctor. \nScrapes chair.\n Now, we've brought you here because we have some questions for you. Given that you can speak, we believe that you have the most experience in communication and wish for your cooperation. Do you understand me?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Yes Doctor, I do. But if you need me to write something down then I think \"The Scribe\" would be more helpful to you.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll opens his clipboard and begins to write.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Good. Well\u2026 \nClears throat.\n We've found a better location to house you. If you give us some information we can speed up your transfer. I assume you already got tired of the\u2026 stale room?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Oh yeah. But the rest is coming with me, right?\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n After the evaluations are done, we would like to transfer your group together.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Sounds good to me. So Doctor, what is your first question?\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Well- \nClicks pen.\n does your group have a purpose\u2014 or rather, do you have any goals?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n A goal? No, I don't think so. We just like to be helpful. I don't even remember having a long-term goal.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Helpful, you say\u2026 Hmm. What did you previously help with, then?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n We were stage-props in a theater. You know, like background figures and stuff like that. Sometimes as clothing dolls like normal mannequins. We were lucky enough to be displayed sometimes for some exhibitions.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n I'm sorry, but we are not planning on displaying you any time soon.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Then please let us take some small tasks, some requests. We'd like to feel purposeful again. I don't want to spend the rest of my days inactive without consciousness or locked within walls.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Let's assume we are open for your help, what could you do for us then?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n We can do anything associated with our skills and experience of course. We are only having this conversation because of that, I'm the only one that can speak, remember?\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Yes, your ability to speak makes you a unique mannequin but it is not an ability unique to you. How did you get these \"skills\" in the first place?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n When the theater lost its last funds and filed for bankruptcy, everyone took the valuable things and left. But we weren't valuable. Mannequins are difficult to rehouse too, so they left us there in the dark, to collect dust. We were left there all dressed up for so long that we started our \nown\n play, it was quite entertaining even without an audience.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n \nScribbling.\n That\u2026 is interesting. \nPauses.\n So for the record, if you had fishing equipment on at the time you would have become something like a fisherman?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n I guess. We'd probably also refer to that person as \"The Fisherman\", or something similar. Talk about living up to the name\u2026\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Interesting\u2026 Interesting indeed. Kawinski, please give SCP-5147-32 the contents from the second drawer.\n\n\nThe guard (Aleksander Kawinski) gives SCP-5147-32 a pen and paper.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Thanks Kawinski. \nClears throat.\n Now, SCP-5147-32, can you please identify each individual from your group.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Of course, give me a moment.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n \nSlides a paper over the desk.\n You can use this photo.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Thank you.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32 begins to write, Dr. Hiveldyll sips from his coffee.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Do you want me to write their abilities down too?\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n I'd just like you to name everyone for the time being. We can ask that later.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Okay, give me a moment, please.\n\n\nFast-forward the tape; SCP-5147-32 hands over the papers to Dr. Hiveldyll.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Uh\u2026 You identified SCP-5147-17 as \"The Killer\". Does he have interests in these aspects?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Oh, no he doesn't. But I also think you are misunderstanding something here, Doctor.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n And what would that be?\n\n\nA. Kawinski:\n \nClears throat.\n Doctor, may I suggest the addition of extra measures to SCP-5147-17's containment before we continue?\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Yes\u2014 Yes of course. I also want extra surveillance. You can guard him by yourself for the time being.\n\n\nA. Kawinski:\n I'll have my leave then. Take care Doctor.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n I'll make a new schedule and inform the team. We'll have to see what SCP-5147-17 is capable of later.\n\n\nKawinski leaves, another guard takes his place.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n So about this misunderstanding\u2026\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Yes, just because his name is associated with some horrifying things doesn't mean that we don't have morals. Also, I'd like to point out that we were figures and fitting dolls in the past, not some assassins.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n That makes sense but you can't be too careful. Even if it makes me a stereotypical son of a bitch. \nDrinks his coffee.\n What would you do with The Killer then? Let him roam free? I know from this conversation that you aren't that stupid.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n I don't know, you can probably make a forensic scientist from him or let him perform autopsies. I guess instead of letting him kill, you can get him to look after the killed. Should be a piece of cake without the stress of leaving fingerprints on fragile material.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Maybe a bit far-fetched but the outcome seems interesting enough to invest in.\n\n\nScribbling can be heard on the recording.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Sorry for interrupting your work but do you have more questions for me? To be honest I'd rather go back now if you are busy with whatever it is you're doing.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n Oh, excuse me. I sometimes get too engaged with my work. I do have one more question though.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Well Doctor, let's hear it then.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n So you have morals like most humans and can give signals of emotional attachment- No, involvement. You clearly have a mental capability.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n I'm glad you realize that.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n But what about your physical capability, your condition? Can you feel exhaustion? Do you have a sense of pain?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n I do, I can feel natural pain. But we're definitely not as fragile as normal mannequins. We don't break that easily. I think the feeling of exhaustion isn't completely present in us, but also not unknown to us. I can't really answer that part of your question.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n That is something we can figure out later. Do you happen to know what happens when you break? Has your group lost some members?\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n No, we haven't lost anyone. I don't exactly know what happens when we break. I do know that we can recover from wounds just like you can.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n So you have some regenerative abilities, I think we need to test that later.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n I'm not looking forward to that, but I don't have much choice do I?\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n I'll try to see if there are anesthetics we could use. I'm trying to test your regeneration, not your pain limit.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n Thanks, I appreciate that.\n\n\nA speaker in the room creaks.\n\n\nLeading staff:\n SCP-5147-32, thank you for cooperating. Dr. Hiveldyll, this suffices for now, please finish the interview.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll:\n \nClicks his pen.\n You've given us some valuable information. I'll see what I can do for the upcoming transfer and the tests in the future. Perhaps I should give you a request too if I ever get the chance.\n\n\nSCP-5147-32:\n I'll be waiting for you when that happens Doctor.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n SCP-5147's transfer to the Humanoid Containment Site-06-3 was approved by leading staff from both locations. SCP-5147 was able to receive tasks/requests in a testing-period of 2 months. Due to the successful outcomes and rise in morale in staff/SCP-5147, this period was prolonged indefinitely.\n\n\nDr. Hiveldyll did not find compatible anesthetics due to SCP-5147 not having any organ systems. Dr. Hiveldyll did not start researching the regenerative abilities of SCP-5147.\n\nDr. Hiveldyll became permanently assigned to SCP-5147.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-1: Unusual requests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\nAdditional notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15/7/2013\n\nCook the staff's dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5147-03 \"The Cook\" made pumpkin soup and sandwiches for the staff.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5147-03 can taste with its fingertips when needed.\n\n\nSCP-5147-03 makes lunch twice a week for assigned personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30/12/2013\n\nExplain the cause of death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5147-17 \n\"The Killer\"\n \"The Forensic\" was able to identify and prove different causes of death from 10 D-class individuals.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5147-17 is henceforth known as \"The Forensic\".\n\n\nInstances can be re-schooled if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24/4/2014\n\nReplicate a house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5147-12 \"The Constructor\" worked together with 26\n\nD-class individuals.\n\n\nD-6322 threw a brick at its head as assigned by Dr. Chauloz\u00e9, breaking SCP-5147-12, who recovered after 3 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Chauloz\u00e9 was afterwards unable to get his requests accepted by any instances.
