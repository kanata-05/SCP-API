Personnel seeking clearance to test SCP-2398 must submit the proper paperwork to the Site-81 Head of Research Administration\u2019s office.\n\n\nPersonnel testing SCP-2398 are forbidden from swinging SCP-2398 towards any other Foundation personnel.\n\n\nUpdated Containment Procedures:\n Testing of SCP-2398 is currently restricted.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2398 is a plain wooden baseball bat, roughly 110cm in length and made of ash with a taped grip. SCP-2398 bears no unusual markings other than the letters \u201cK.O.\u201d branded into the wood just above the handle.\n\n\nSCP-2398 displays no anomalous properties when not in use; however, when swung at a speed over roughly 20m/s, any living organism that SCP-2398 comes in contact with at the end of a swing will violently explode. The mechanism for this is currently unknown.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n SCP-2398 was discovered by Foundation personnel embedded in City of Toronto local authorities after an altercation between Toronto Blue Jays baseball player Carl Thomas and a group of young men and women. One of the men, seeing Mr. Thomas approaching his vehicle after leaving a nearby nightclub, attempted to assault Mr. Thomas in an attempted robbery, quickly accompanied by three other men and two women. Mr. Thomas managed to get SCP-2398 out of the back seat of his car and swung it at one of the women, causing her body to detonate. The assailants quickly dispersed, and a passerby called the police.\n\n\nAddendum 2398.1:\n Interview\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n Alright, you already spoke with Officer Marco. We just need to know, for the record, what happened tonight.\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n Man, I already told you I don\u2019t know what happened. That girl must\u2019ve had a bomb in her bag or something. I was trying to fight them off, you know, and then she come at me so I took a swing at her. Next thing I know there\u2019s a sound like a balloon popping, and she\u2019s just\u2026 everywhere. Yo, I heard about them before. You know, uhh\u2026 suicide bombers. That\u2019s some fucked up shit.\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n Mr. Thomas, where did you get the bat you had that night?\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n Bat? (\nPauses\n) Yo, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, man.\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n I can promise you that this will go a lot better for you if you tell us what we need to know.\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n Hang on, I want a lawyer. I ain\u2019t saying shit until I get a lawyer.\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n I\u2019m not a cop, and you won\u2019t be getting a lawyer.\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n (\nPauses uncomfortably\n) Look man, I don\u2019t know about all this, man. I just\u2026 look, I heard some talk about they weren\u2019t gonna renew my contract. My numbers haven\u2019t been great since the injury, so you know. Sometimes you gotta do some shit.\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n And the bat?\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n A friend of a friend. I might\u2019ve cheated, but I ain\u2019t no snitch.\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n What does it do?\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n You didn\u2019t see? Three home runs, four RBIs. Best game of my career. It hits homers, man. That\u2019s all it does. It\u2019s a really good bat.\n\n\nDr. Towns:\n That\u2019s all it does?\n\n\nMr. Thomas:\n (\nPauses\n) Oh, shit. I guess not, huh?\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 2398.2:\n Testing Log\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.01\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by an operator at a melon.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Melon is knocked onto the floor and smashed. No difference from non-anomalous control test.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nNothing out of the ordinary here. Fruit is unaffected. -Dr. Towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.02\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by an operator at a regulation baseball.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Baseball flies towards the wall of the test chamber in a steep arc and embeds itself roughly 15cm into the steel wall of the chamber.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nIt seems to be ectoentropic; the ball definitely left the bat going faster than the bat was swung. Interesting. -Dr. Towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.03\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by an operator at a beach ball.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Beach ball is knocked across the testing chamber. No difference from non-anomalous control test.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nThis is very interesting. Somehow, the bat is able to differentiate between baseballs and other balls. I wonder if softballs are likewise unaffected. -Dr. Towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.04\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by an operator at a regulation softball.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Softball combusts, but does not explode.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nHuh. -Dr. Towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.05\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by an operator at a test chicken.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Test chicken violently explodes, sending feathers and viscera across the testing chamber. Operator is injured when a piece of beak becomes lodged in their arm. SCP-2398 is unaffected.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nNotably, our control chicken was also killed when we hit it with a non-anomalous baseball bat. This was a little more dramatic, but there might be a better test to run here. -Dr. Towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.06\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by an operator at a test cow.\n\n\nTest Results:\n Test cow violently explodes. Operator is killed as a result of the explosion. Testing chamber is severely damaged.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nThe more massive the creature, the more violent the explosion. The good news is our test cow wasn\u2019t killed when we hit it with a regular bat, so we\u2019re at least seeing a notable difference now. -Dr. Towns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest ID:\n 2398.07\n\n\nTesting Parameters:\n SCP-2398 is swung by a machine at a test pig.\n\n\nTest Results:\n During setup of the swinging robotic arm rig, the arm swings prematurely, striking Dr. Towns in the arm and causing him to violently explode. The swinging robotic arm rig is destroyed. The resulting explosion causes SCP-2398 to arc across the test chamber and strike the test pig, which also violently explodes. That explosion causes SCP-2398 to then strike two D-Class personnel used as operators in earlier tests, who also violently explode. The test chamber is destroyed as a result of the four explosions. SCP-2398 is unaffected, and later placed back into containment.\n\n\nNotes:\n \nWe\u2019re probably going to suspend testing of this for a while. -Dr. Lyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-2397\n | SCP-2398 | \nSCP-2399\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-2398\n\" by djkaktus, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
