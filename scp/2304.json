Any images found to contain cognitohazardous properties are to be systematically removed from their respective image hosting services and saved to a Foundation server.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2304 is the collective designation for a group of at least 14 images all carrying some degree of cognitohazardous properties\n1\n. SCP-2304 instances take the form of common internet memes\n2\n, and are artificially over-processed and edited for comedic effect. All SCP-2304 instances carry the ability to cause spontaneous muscle cell growth upon viewing, often resulting in \ndeath\n \nthe constriction of air passages and consequent medical issues. (UPDATED \n2020-09-12\n)\n\n\nDiscovery Log:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2304 first came to the Foundation's attention in 2019, after a series of suspicious deaths from constricted airways caused by extreme cell growth in the throat. It was initially classified as an unknown vector, but following the \u03a9K \"End of Death\" scenario on 2020-09-12, several surviving victims were located and interviewed to discover the source of the anomaly. A victim of an SCP-2304 instance revealed to Foundation personnel that they had acquired the SCP-2304 instance from an internet relay chatroom, #\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, under the handle \"OxyGenesis\". Agent Smith was chosen to attempt to infiltrate this community, under the handle \"PebbleTooth\".\n\n\n\n\nAttached Files:\n\n\n\n\n#\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0Excerpts\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt: September 28th, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPebbleTooth has joined.\n\n\nKomodo:\n \nOPS\n does anybody know this guy\n\n\ncommodore69:\n im gonna fucking punt you if you keep pinging us for dumb shit\n\n\nPebbleTooth:\n \nKomodo:\n hello\n\n\nFastNJammin:\n \nPebbleTooth:\n yo, how did you like\n\n\nFastNJammin:\n find this place\n\n\nstormstorm:\n through the internet, id bet\n\n\nFastNJammin:\n \nstormstorm:\n kinda busy here\n\n\nPebbleTooth:\n \nFastNJammin:\n A friend thought i'd like it, OxyGenesis.\n\n\nKomodo:\n oh fuck, oxygenesis\n\n\nstormstorm:\n haven't seen him for a while\n\n\nPebbleTooth:\n he got busy with irl stuff\n\n\nFastNJammin:\n I trust oxy's judgement. welcome.\n\n\nPebbleTooth:\n so, uh\n\n\nPebbleTooth:\n what goes on here? oxy told me something about like, memes\n\n\nstormstorm:\n oxy probably explained to u what anart is, right?\n\n\nPebbleTooth:\n he told me they were like irl memes\n\n\nTakeovermetal\n uploaded file \n1632838905.png\n 1mb \n\u2b07\n\n\nFastNJammin\n kicked \nTakeovermetal\n.
