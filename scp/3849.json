The property is to remain locked, with access restricted to personnel with 4/3849 clearance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3849 is a region of space located within a wall-mounted bathtub on the second floor of 810 Danforth St, Portland, ME. The area of space to which SCP-3849 connects has been determined to exist 4.43 billion years in the past, at some location within the confines of Earth's gravity well.\n1\n\n\nSCP-3849 induces no negative pressure in the surrounding room, though any object placed into the anomalous space will continue to fall towards the planet. Due to the narrow window of view available, the surface of Earth cannot be seen.\n\n\nSCP-3849 was first discovered on 8-18-18, when homeowner Chris Mattingly contacted local authorities, claiming that his wife, Christina Mattingly, had \"fallen into space in the bathtub\".\n\n\nAddendum 3849-TL:\n SCP-3849 Test log\n\n\nTest A - 8/20/18\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n One sealed time capsule with Barium-130 isotope half-life dating apparatus.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Time capsule dropped into SCP-3849.
