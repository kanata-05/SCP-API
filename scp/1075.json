SCP-1075-1 appears in the upper-right of the photograph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-1075\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Adjunct Site 13 is to be utilized for direct monitoring of SCP-1075-1. The property containing SCP-1075-1 has been purchased by Southern Crosscut Pines. The property is to be surrounded by fencing to prevent unauthorized entry. Foundation agents located in Adjunct Site 13 are to patrol the fenced perimeter regularly for unauthorized individuals. Any unauthorized individuals are to be removed from the property immediately.\n\n\nUnder no circumstances are individual trees considered part of SCP-1075-1 by local residents to be damaged by Foundation activities.\n\n\nMobile Task Force Theta-29 \"Michael Palins\" are to be utilized to manipulate public opinion of SCP-1075-1 in the local community. See Document Lambda-4 for more details.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1075 is an anomalous psychological effect which is extant among permanent residents of Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Those subject to SCP-1075's effect believe a clonal colony of 493 trees belonging to the species \nPopulus tremuloides\n (and which are designated SCP-1075-1) is a human resident of Pagosa Springs, Colorado. SCP-1075-1, referred to by local residents as \"Vince\", does not appear to, itself, be anomalous.\n\n\nSCP-1075-1 was, prior to Foundation intervention, believed by sufferers of SCP-1075 to be a well respected member of the Pagosa Springs community. It was listed as a member of the town council, considered active in local charitable organizations, and a focus of romantic interest for several female and at least one male resident. Due to Foundation efforts (outlined in Document Lambda-4) newly formed anomalous memories of SCP-1075-1 appear to be focused on avoidance of the individual.\n\n\nThose suffering from the effects of SCP-1075 are unable to be swayed from the belief that SCP-1075-1 is a human individual. The majority of long time residents are able to recall detailed and intricate memories relating to interactions with SCP-1075-1. Furthermore, the county registrar's office, along with several other local organizations, have several official documents on file relating to SCP-1075-1. The following is a list of pertinent extant documents.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Show\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance footage of the day and time this ID was applied for do not reveal any individuals of note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA birth certificate dated to February 10th in the year 201 AD.\n\n\nA driver license (pictured right).\n1\n\n\nA marriage certificate between Vince Aspenson and an individual known as Elizabeth Aspenson (N\u00e9e Albareda)\n\n\nCourt documents relating to a divorce settlement with Elizabeth Aspenson (N\u00e9e Albareda).\n\n\nA high school diploma.\n\n\nA bachelors degree in astronomy.\n\n\nA property deed in Vincent Aspenson's name for the land currently occupied by SCP-1075-1.\n\n\nSeveral police reports. (see document Lambda-4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a02\u00a0Access\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Elizabeth\u00a0Albareda\u00a0Interview\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda was located shortly after SCP-1075's original containment. Though Ms. Albareda had no memory of SCP-1075-1, an attempt was made to change her legally registered address to inside Pagosa Springs city limits for the duration of this interview. Despite being conducted outside of SCP-1075's normal area of affect, this was sufficient to affect the temporary restoration of Ms. Albareda's false memories of SCP-1075-1.\n\n\nThis interview was conducted under the guise of a security clearance background check. Elizabeth Albareda did not attempt to contact SCP-1075-1 following the interview.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n October 18th, 2012.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Malcolm\n\n\nSubject:\n Elizabeth Albareda\n\n\nLocation:\n Elizabeth Albareda's Domicile.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n What was Mr. Aspenson doing at Greendale before you met?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n You know\u2026 at first he couldn't even talk to me. He was supposed to be there for transfer credits but he told me he didn't learn anything from Greendale except how to talk to girls.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n How did you meet him?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n Back in 1998 we were both taking Spanish. It was an easy credit for me since my grandmother was from Mexico. Vincent was in way over his head though. I was tutoring him. One thing led to another and\u2026 you know.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n Why did you decide to get married?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n That\u2026 that was all him. We were young and stupid. We made a lot of\u2026 well\u2026 a lot of mistakes.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n What do you mean?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n We were only dating for a couple of months when I got pregnant. He told me he loved me\u2026 but I think he was just trying to do the right thing.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n What happened?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n He had me meet his parents and we got married that weekend. It was fast but\u2026 Pagosa Springs is beautiful in the spring.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n We don't have any records of a child.\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n He was born in Denver at UC hospital. They should have his records.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n What was his name?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n Joshua. Vincent picked it out. Said it was 'cause he was Vincent's salvation.\n\n\nAt this point Ms. Albareda begins to have an emotional episode. It takes several minutes for her to recover enough to continue.\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n I'm sorry. I thought I'd put it all behind me.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n It's fine Ms. Albareda. What happened?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n Joshua was born with Neuroblastoma. I\u2026 I didn't even know a baby could be born with cancer.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n Did he survive?\n\n\nAt this point Ms. Albareda lost her composure again. Per standard protocol Agent Malcolm changed the topic of conversation in order to maximize the information gathered from the interview.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n What happened, uh, after that.\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n I didn't think I could ever get over it. But eventually I guess I did. I think Vincent actually loved me. He just\u2026 he was broken after that. And I couldn't help him.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n So you got a divorce?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n I felt horrible. He retreated into himself. He almost quit school, but I told him the same thing he told me when I got pregnant: \"It's our future as much as the kid's. If you love him, you'll keep trying to better yourself.\"\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n And then?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n I guess he replaced me with school work. He didn't even show up for the hearing. I had to courier him the papers to sign. He lost a son but\u2026 I lost two people I cared about that day.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n When was the last time you talked to him?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n It was a couple of years after that, I uh, I called him about his parents. The funeral was\u2026 it was spring.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n Why didn't you try to talk to him after that?\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n I honestly don't know. I feel like maybe\u2026 I think I reminded him too much of the past. I didn't want to hurt him anymore.\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n Thank you for your time Ms. Albareda. I appreciate your candor.\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n How is he doing anyway?\n\n\nAgent Malcolm:\n He's actually getting married again.\n2\n\n\nElizabeth Albareda:\n Oh. Ok. That's great.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this interview Ms. Albareda's legal residence was switched back to her previous address, resulting in the elimination of all memories relating to SCP-1075-1. No records relating to Joshua Albareda exist in the University of Colorado medical archives. While Greendale City College has extensive records relating to Ms. Albareda, no records of SCP-1075-1 exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a03\u00a0Access\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0Lambda-4\u00a0Documents\n\n\n\n\nDue to SCP-1075-1's popularity among SCP-1075 sufferers, early Foundation containment efforts were focused on the reversal of this public opinion to limit the spread of public knowledge of SCP-1075-1. Due to Pagosa Spring's regular tourism, several Foundation assets posing as tourists filed assault claims against the SCP-1075-1. Though the first few accusations were improperly addressed, local law enforcement began to take the issue more seriously as accusations mounted.\n\n\nOn March 8th 2013, law enforcement officers traveled to SCP-1075-1's listed address and remained inside their car for 24 minutes. Following this, the officers reported that SCP-1075-1 was in custody and traveled to the local police station. Though this event appeared to be peaceful, charges of resisting arrest were included in the original indictment.\n\n\nThe case began to move through the local criminal justice system without any observable events. The eventual plea bargain agreement reduced all charges to aggravated assault. SCP-1075-1 received a 6-month suspended sentence (along with 6 months and 1 day of house arrest).\n\n\nThe current local opinion of SCP-1075-1 is to be monitored. If any return to previous popularity appears in newly formed memories of SCP-1075-1, more drastic measures are authorized.\n\n\nFollowing the success of operation Lambda-4, several follow-up interviews were conducted with local residents. All but one individual appeared to have their opinion significantly altered by operation Lambda-4. The following interview with that individual is included for reference.\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n April 25th, 2013.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Stevens\n\n\nSubject:\n Jennifer Small\n\n\nLocation:\n The Great Cheese Diner in Pagosa Springs\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n Thank you for sitting down with me.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n No problem. My dad used to get the Sun\n3\n when I was a kid. He'll be so happy to see my name in it.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n Well, I'm actually doing a story on Aspenson.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n Oh.\n\n\nThere is a pause of several seconds.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n I don't think I want to talk about that.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n What's wrong?\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n It's just\u2026 I've known Vince since high school. He was a straight A student. And even though he got an astronomy degree he was slumming it teaching high school physics. He said he wanted to give back to the community.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n So the accusations hit you pretty hard?\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n I mean. I feel like I know him. Like, really know him, ya know? He's such a gentle soul. I just can't believe he would hurt those people.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n There were 12 different incidents. They can't all be lying.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n Maybe they are? Vince would never do the things they said he did.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n What about the guy from Boulder? He was stuck in the hospital for a week.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n You're right. I know you're right. But he says he didn't do it.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n What does he say happened?\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n Can this not go in the paper?\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n Sure. We'll talk off the record.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n He says he's being framed. He says there's these guys up near his house that're trying to make him look like a monster.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n It doesn't sound like he's doing alright.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n He's not. He's falling apart. He thinks there are people out to get him around every corner.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n What do you think?\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n I think maybe he's not well. I think he needs help and he's not going to get it if they're treating him like a criminal.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n I can put that in the article if you want.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n No. I don't think I want to add anything to the article. I'm sorry.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n That's quite alright. I'm sorry to bother you.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n No it's\u2026 you're not bothering me. But he's said some stuff that makes me wonder. Can you\u2026 can you possibly look into something for me? See if what he's saying holds any water?\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n I can try.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n He says he's been inside a building the people trying to frame him have put up on his property. He says there's proof there that he's telling the truth.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n I\u2026 I uh can look into that, yeah. Did he say where it was?\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n Just that it was on his property. Go talk to him and he can take you right to it.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n I will\u2026 do that then.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n Thank you so much. I care about him a lot. We never quite clicked but\u2026 I miss the old him.\n\n\nAgent Stevens:\n I'll see what I can do to help. Thanks for sitting down with me.\n\n\nJennifer Small:\n Thank you so much!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this interview Foundation agents willed a property to Jennifer Small in Maine through a distant relative. Due to the size of the inheritance, Small moved away from Pagosa Springs. Further interviews indicate she is now free of the effects of SCP-1075. It is believed that there are no longer any SCP-1075 sufferers currently sympathetic to SCP-1075-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. The printed spelling of Aspenson appears to contain an error. This spelling (\"Apsenson\") does not match the signed spelling nor the spelling in any other documents.\n\n\n2\n. While this is untrue, it was deemed the best response to eliminate the possibility of Ms. Albareda contacting SCP-1075-1 if the anomalous memories could not be eliminated.\n\n\n3\n. For these interviews Agent Stevens posed as a reporter for the Pagosa Springs Sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1074\n | SCP-1075 | \nSCP-1076\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Forest Normally Known As Vince\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone",
