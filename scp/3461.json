If investigation into the changes to your employee contract has brought you here, contact the Office of O5-4 for Level 1/3461 Clearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-3461\n\n\nObject Class:\n Thaumiel\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n The development of SCP-3461 is a Class IX research priority.\n\n\nO5-4 has been designated as the HMCL of SCP-3461, to coordinate all involved departments and approve cross-testing of relevant SCP objects.\n\n\nTo facilitate SCP-3461-\u03b1, the Foundation Disinformation and Theology Departments are to receive \n40%\n budget increases for the \n2046\n fiscal year.\n\n\nThe O5 Council has authorized the use of the \nPANDORA\n Protocol to carry out SCP-3461-\u03b2.\n\n\nUnder the SCP-3461-\u03b3 initiative, a current total of \n021\n anomalies have been reclassified as Thaumiel-class, and a total of \n083\n anomalies have been reclassified as Maksur-class. A comprehensive list is available in Appendix-3461-\u03b3.\n\n\nThe physical components of SCP-3461-\u03b4 are to be kept in dedicated, maximum-security containment facilities. No Foundation personnel, except for maintenance engineers with Level 5/3461 Clearance, are authorized to enter the components' respective containment chambers. Component-specific containment procedures are available on a need-to-know basis in Appendix-3461-\u03b4.\n\n\nEfforts to extend SCP-3461 to the civilian population are underway.\n\n\n\n\nI'll keep things concise for now. This effort, while tangential to primary containment, is no less important. It is aligned with the Foundation's zeroth goal, and thus has its full backing.\n\n\n- The Administrator\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3461 designates a multi-faceted Foundation project to engineer an afterlife hospitable to humankind.\n\n\nSCP-3461-\u03b1 is a worldwide implementation of the \nGenius Loci\n protocol, as to alter collective religious belief on life after death. The goal of SCP-3461-\u03b1 is to increase the inclusivity/amiability of any possibly extant, Leibniz-class dimensions. This entails a mass-scale social engineering program, promoting belief in universal salvation (or equivalents) in the world's major religions. Foundation-funded theologians, implants in religious institutions, and grassroots religious movements are currently part of the program. As per the \nTriumvirate\n agreement, the Foundation is obliged to help the Horizon Initiative in creating \"The Universal Texts\". Such efforts are to focus on advancing SCP-3461-\u03b1 through the discovery and/or forgery of manuscripts that support this soteriological narrative.\n\n\n\n\nThere is nothing sacred to the Foundation. Truth and falsehood are only as valuable as they are useful. What is happening here is no different than what has been done for decades, centuries, even millennia.\n\n\nIt's a small comfort, I know. Even if you presuppose that the Foundation was just \"discovering\" and spreading the truth, the callousness at which it pays off great minds, manipulates masses, and forges scripture must weigh on the faithful among us. Nonetheless, we have a duty to look after the wellbeing of humanity in all of its forms. If it soothes your conscience, I advise that you consider it less so \"doctoring\" and more so \"progressive revelation\".\n\n\n- Yusuf Zafarul, Theology Department Head\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3461-\u03b2 is the neutralization of all verified, inhospitable afterlives under Foundation purview. This serves to funnel human consciousnesses into Foundation-approved afterlives, created and maintained by the other components of SCP-3461. Under the PANDORA Protocol, the utilization of all assets available to the Foundation, including anomalous objects, is permitted to accomplish this objective.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3461-\u03b2-ABRIDGED-LOG:\u00a0LEVEL\u00a01\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0VERIFIED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPertinent Anomalies\n\n\nNeutralization method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-107\n \nSCP-475\n \nSCP-1844\n\n\nMTF \u03c9-144 instructed to utilize SCP-475 and to pour resultant liquids into SCP-107.

Consciously or subconsciously, your mind is filling in the gaps.\n\n\nThere is no impetus for this initiative, no hitherto-unknown threat rearing its head, no XK-Class Apocalypse happening ahead of schedule. The world is in no more or no less danger than it always is. I promise to you all that it won't end tomorrow, or the day after, or the day after. The more cynical of you will question if it's my promise to make.\n\n\nWe aren't fatalists here. If nothing else, it's bad for employee morale. If you have a high enough clearance to access this file, you'll have an inkling of the kind of threats that loom over humanity's head. You'll think that we've gotten desperate.\n\n\nSCP-3461 is neither an admission of defeat nor a shift of priorities. It, like every other entry in this database, represents a duty the Foundation is beholden to.\n\n\n- O5-4, HMCL Supervisor\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3461-\u03b3 is MTF \u03b1-0 (\"Fishers of Dead Men\"), an esoteric taskforce composed primarily of Type VI Volitional Spiritual Apparitions. This main squadron is supplemented by a number of Pistiphagic, Tartarean, Infomorphic, or Ectomorphic Anomalous Entities serving as secondary assets. MTF \u03b1-0 is tasked with the neutralization of threats to SCP-3461, typically those that prey on human soulforms, offer type-6 geases, or inhabit Leibniz-class dimensions. A secondary function of the taskforce is to safeguard human soulforms until exit from baseline reality.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3461-\u03b3-ABRIDGED-LOG:\u00a0LEVEL\u00a03\u00a0CLEARANCE\u00a0REQUIRED\n\n\n\n\nCREDENTIALS\u00a0VERIFIED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaskforce Asset\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-049\n\n\n[\nDATA EXPUNGED\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3004\n\n\nPoI-6870's secondary anomalous properties, gained from the execution of Protocol Damnatio ad Bestias, make him suited for esoteric combat with Pistiphagic entities. PoI-6870's cooperation is contingent on non-interference treaty with GoI-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3540\n\n\nSCP-3540-1 and SCP-3540-2 agree to act as intermediaries to similar psychopompic entities, provided that their containment protocols concerning halloween festivity are loosened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3899\n\n\nSCP-3899 has suspected psychopompic properties. All attempts at recruitment have failed. Attempts at termination are not advised. Low priority target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4069\n\n\nSCP-4069-B, after conversation with the Administrator, offered its services to the Foundation. It has since neutralized SCP-3434 and SCP-4069. Refer to SCP-3461-\u03b4 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-4999\n\n\nCommunication with SCP-4999 has been achieved. Attempts to enlist it have thus far stalled, but the subject appears amiable to civilian deployment of SCP-3461.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra-planar warfare has come a long way since the early days of Identity Warfare Training.\n\n\nThe Foundation as has seen some change since those days. We're better equipped and better prepared then we've ever been. Alpha-Zero is emblematic of that change, enlisting anomalies we previously jailed, fighting entities we didn't even know how to classify before. And unlike certain other agencies, we're capable of coexisting with the anomalous, without drafting it or killing it. On top of all that, we're safeguarding Foundation personnel from entropy itself.

All efforts will be made to prevent it coming to harm.\" Concise, I know. Justifiably, you'll have your reservations. But there are no strings attached, there is no twist. Upper management has decided that each human being is entitled to paradise, and thus set about to create an artificial, pleasant afterlife. Your spirit, should you entrust it to us, will be put in various states approximating eternal bliss.

At the onset, we prided ourselves as a humanitarian effort. Doing good by keeping the natural order, maintaining a precarious peace. This holds true, but we didn't know the full scope this mission entailed.\n\n\nIt seemed like the more we advanced, the more daunting our duty was. As our numbers rose, so did theirs. The more we learned, the more we realized what we started out with didn't make sense.\n\n\nBut we must keep mankind protected.\n And we've now found ourselves in the position to do the ultimate good.\n\n\nI won't sweep aside the sacrifices and moral calculus that we've had to do, but this is the opportunity to ensure the safety and sanity of every soul. We can make up for every wrong.\n\n\n\n\nWe are here to serve.\n\n\n- The Administrator\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. A Thaumiel-class object.
