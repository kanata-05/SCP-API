When testing, SCP-1523 is to be lit with a handheld gas lighter. While SCP-1523 is burning, it is to be enclosed in an airtight chamber with all attending personnel wearing gas masks to avoid propagation or inhalation of SCP-1523 smoke.\n\n\nAll interactions with SCP-1523 are to be recorded and filed in Interview Log 1523. When testing is concluded, SCP-1523 is to be extinguished promptly. The object is never to burn while unattended.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1523 is an orange-brown incense coil. While SCP-1523 is burning, the object displays sapience; it is responsive to verbal stimuli and capable of speech, using a voice identical to that of a musician named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n1\n The object possesses complete memory of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's life\n2\n. The Foundation cannot determine whether SCP-1523 held the same personality traits in life; its current demeanor, including its obsession with religion, may result from its current form.\n\n\nAccording to SCP-1523's account, it was created on 05/04/05 in a \"star chapel\" of the North American cult known as the \nFifth Church\n during a \"cleansing ritual\". SCP-1523 was stored in a closet, suspended on an incense holder which bore a tag reading \"BROTHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 TERRES TRIAL MIND\". Following a Foundation sting (see \nEID Operations Report 6-11-05\n, \"Operation Stargazer\"), several ritual items were secured, including SCP-1523, which underwent experimentation due to its unusual nomenclature, then was designated and contained.\n\n\nAddendum 1523-A\n: After testing (see interview logs), it has been determined that SCP-1523's ability to hear and speak is a property of its smoke, rather than of the object itself. Although SCP-1523 is apparently not conscious when unlit, attempts to determine the range and duration at which SCP-1523 smoke retains its effect have been inconclusive. Note that Site 40 cleaning procedures are to be strictly enforced, to prevent the contamination of the facility with SCP-1523.\n\n\n\n\nInterview\u00a01523-01,\u00a0Abridged\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All information pertaining to classified Fifthist activity has been redacted as per Operation Stargazer protocol.\n\n\nBegin Log: 13:04:16\n\n\nInterviewer\n: \n[The interviewer provides SCP-1523 with standard introductory information for contained humanoids.]\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: Call me \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, star-exalted brother.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: I will keep using your designation, if that's alright. So can you confirm that you are \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: No doubt.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: And you're aware of your state?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: Very.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Are you capable of anything besides speech?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: Hertz, brother, I can sing.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Can you perform something for the record?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: You got any requests?\n\n\n[The security officer suggests \"Let's Stay Together\", a standard which [REDACTED] occasionally performed in concert.]\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: It serves, brother. It serves. Let me put a spin on it.\n\n\n[SCP-1523 performs a completely different piece with a dissonant melody and lyrics which are presumed to refer to Fifthist doctrines. The first verse consists of the phrase \"there is power in the blood\" repeated in different cadences. Full lyrics are available in the unabridged transcript.]\n\n\nInterviewer\n: \n[pause]\n That will do. Can you tell us how you were placed in your current state?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: Wisdom serves. It was a [REDACTED] cleansing ritual. Everyone was in the groove as the archon played. Spinning like records. Screaming like records, too. \n[laughs]\n My [REDACTED] unhinged like a snake's jaw, and my soul came forth, brother. The archon stuck it here for posterity.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: What happened to your body?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: Still going strong. It doesn't miss me much.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: You're saying that your body continues to function without a consciousness.\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: No, brother, without a soul. Ever seen an anthill? That ant doesn't have room for a soul in there. If a man has no soul, he can keep building his anthill just fine. Right now the man I was is occupied with [REDACTED] and you couldn't tell the difference if you met it, unless you were giving it a throat exam. \n[laughs]\n He's quiet in there, but he wriggles around like he can't get comfortable.\n\n\nInterviewer\n: Is this a common phenomenon?\n\n\nSCP-1523\n: More than you think, brother. I'd bet my blood there are brothers and sisters working with you in this building whose souls left a long time ago. Bodies serve, too. But those sweet souls [REDACTED] in time.
