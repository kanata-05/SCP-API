Containment personnel are to remain in Uranus' orbit and monitor SCP-4829's state.\n\n\nIn the event that SCP-4829's containment staff deem neutralization necessary, one instance of \nSCP-2501-EX\n will be immediately delivered to them from orbital storage by MTF Mu-119 (\"Red Squadron\").\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4829 is Uranus' moon Umbriel.\n\n\nSCP-4829 repeatedly generates large, flower-like structures made of ice or rock along its surface; each of these structures measures up to 40\u00a0km tall and moves rhythmically for several months before sinking back below the surface. Routine probes determined that beneath the ice lies a gelatinous layer of dissolved hydrocarbons, proteins and enzymes.\n\n\nOn 9/19/2072, Foundation astronauts Chad Roland, Vanessa Marquez, and Monica Lorenz descended from Umbriel's orbit in a lander to investigate SCP-4829\u2019s surface.\n\n\n\n\n[The following log is transcribed from Monica Lorenz's bodycam.]\n\n\n[\nBEGIN LOG\n]\n\n(\nThe camera jolts as the lander touches down on Umbriel's surface.\n)\n\n\nRoland:\n Mission Control, this is Skywalker. We've landed half a kilometer from one of the structures.\n\n\nMission Control:\n Roger, \nSkywalker\n, we copy. Excellent job.\n\n\nRoland:\n Stepping out.\n\n\n(\nRoland opens the airlock and climbs onto the ladder.\n)\n\n\nMarquez:\n Performing thruster diagnostics, stand by.\n\n\n(\nRoland descends the ladder and steps onto the surface, with Lorenz following on the ladder.\n)\n\n\nRoland:\n Surface appears- what the fuck?!\n\n\nLorenz:\n Are you alright?\n\n\n(\nRoland sinks into the regolith up to his knees, and his space suit dissolves. His body balloons and stretches into an ellipsoid shape as his skin becomes translucent white.\n)\n\n\nLorenz:\n Oh shit! Vanessa, get us out of here!\n\n\n(\nLorenz climbs back into the lander and disconnects Roland's tether, throwing the remaining length out of the lander.\n)\n\n\n(\nRoland sinks further into the surface and bursts, spreading white liquid across several square meters of ice. The liquid is pulled into the surface and the ground shakes.\n)\n\n\n(\nLorenz closes the lander door.\n)\n\n\nMarquez:\n Fuck! 3, 2, 1, ignition!\n\n\n(\nThe camera feed shakes as the lander takes off.\n)\n\n[\nEND LOG\n]\n\n\nPostscript:\n As Lorenz and Marquez returned to orbit, the surface of SCP-4829 cracked along the equator, causing vast amounts of lunar material to fall into the widening chasm. SCP-4829 continued to crack until it fully split into two identical, smaller instances of itself.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 9/21/2072:\n SCP-4829 is currently thousands of small moons attached to each other in a spherical arrangement, dividing roughly every 13 hours. Orbital data shows SCP-4829's constituent objects to be composed of cytoplasm, surrounded by shells of ice and rock.\n\n\nUPDATE 9/23/2072:\n Individual lunar structures now number beyond 20,000. SCP-4829 remains roughly the same size.\n\n\nUPDATE 10/11/2072:\n SCP-4829\u2019s orbit decays further; causing it to fall into the \u03b5 ring (Uranus' brightest ring). The ring material rearranges, sheathing SCP-4829 in a diffuse cloud while a stream of ice particles extends down to connect SCP-4829 with Uranus' atmosphere. Gas from the atmosphere flows up the ice stream, covering SCP-4829 further.\n\n\nUPDATE 11/14/2072:\n SCP-4829 has deformed and is no longer spherical. Sensors indicate a rhythmic, repeating vibration generated by SCP-4829\u2019s core at a rate of 110-120 beats per minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4828\n | SCP-4829 | \nSCP-4830\n \u00bb",
