Exploration and research teams that come within 100 kilometres of this exclusion zone are to be re-directed to their basecamp under the guise of \"seismic activity\".\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4752 is a large mountain located at the southern end of the Transantarctic Mountain Range resembling a right angle triangle with a concave hypotenuse. Geological studies have indicated that since the late 16th century, SCP-4752's mass has been slowly concentrating beneath its peak, at the far west of the mountain, with no non-anomalous geological explanation. The rate of transfer has been accelerating since the 1980s. As of 2019, 44% of SCP-4752's mass was concentrated beneath its peak.\n\n\nAddendum-4752-001:\n Geological studies have indicated significant shifts in mass on the following dates, amongst others:\n\n\n\n\n33 CE\n\n\nDecember 1792\n\n\n1873 - 1879\n\n\n24/10/1929\n\n\n19/10/1987\n\n\n15/09/2008\n\n\n20/02/2020\n\n\n\n\nAddendum-4752-002:\n On 06/09/2020, GoI-3425 (\"Anochists\") launched an assault on the west side of SCP-4752, during which an estimated 30% of SCP-4752's mass was lost. Members of GoI-3425 planted a nuclear explosive at the base of SCP-4752's west side and detonated it after a retreat. Following this, world economic output suffered a decline of 26%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4751\n | SCP-4752 | \nSCP-4753\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4752\n\" by OCuin, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
