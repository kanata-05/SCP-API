SCP-5003 consists of three different components: a main power housing, a central control hub, and a vast tunnel system expanding from the control center.\n\n\nThe central control hub lies within a cavern located approximately 36km from the entrance with walls lined with wires and cables from the main power housing. Additionally, the cavern contains the following:\n\n\n\n\nA control panel\n\n\nChairs\n\n\nA whiteboard\n\n\nFluorescent lights\n\n\nFour large scorch marks across the eastern and northern walls\n\n\n\n\nThe main power housing is presumed to be located in a chamber\n1\n adjacent to the central control hub, since all cables in SCP-5003 have been traced back to that area. Initial attempts to locate an entrance to this chamber have failed. Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence that this is the power source of SCP-5003. The title \"main power housing\" has been given to the chamber for clearer communication.\n\n\nThe tunnel system is largely unexplored. Initial reconnaissance discovered that they are lit by fluorescent lights and lined with cables that are connected to the main power housing.\n\n\nThe only known entrance to SCP-5003 is through a metal door located in the service tunnels on Sublevel 39 of Site-19. Inspection of the Site-19 blueprints indicated that these tunnels were never originally meant to be part of the site's construction.\n\n\nTesting to identify further effects of SCP-5003 is still underway.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n On 06/21/2014 Site-19 sensors picked up a spike in electromagnetic activity underneath the site. Searches of the lower levels of the site located the doorway to SCP-5003, which was open at time of discovery.\n\n\nSCP-5003 Testing Operation:\n After the initial discovery of SCP-5003, Dr. Raven Koullette proposed a series of experiments to be run on SCP-5003 to determine the functionality of the control panel, and if the anomaly requires additional containment protocols. These experiments were to be carried out by a team consisting of Researcher Thomas DeWalt\n2\n, and D-3481\n3\n to act as a subject and assistant. Since the travel time from the entrance to the control center is approximately 7 hours, DeWalt and D-3481 were equipped with three days worth of water and rations, sleeping bags, flashlights and a standard-issue Foundation Fieldwork Radio to communicate test results back to Dr. Koullette. Testing was scheduled to take place over the course of two days.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-5003\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0Day\u00a0#1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-5003\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0Day\u00a0#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin Log\n>\n\n\nRecording begins. There is a light humming noise in the background.\n\n\nDeWalt:\n Raven, can you hear us?\n\n\nKoullette:\n Loud and clear Thomas. I assume you're ready to start testing?\n\n\nDeWalt:\n Wouldn't have contacted you any earlier. Ready Charles?\n\n\nD-3481:\n I guess.\n\n\nKoullette:\n Alright, let's get this show on the road.\n\n\nDeWalt:\n Charles, can you flip switch 1-A?\n\n\nD-3481:\n Umm\u2026 which one is that?\n\n\nDeWalt:\n It's the blue one over on your left.\n\n\nD-3481:\n Oh. Ok.\n\n\nThe humming stops. A scream is heard, followed by a repeated crackling noise. After a few moments the humming returns.\n\n\nKoullette:\n What happened? Are you ok?\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nKoullette:\n Thomas?\n\n\nD-3481:\n I\u2014 I'm still here.\n\n\nD-3481 is breathing erratically.\n\n\nKoullette:\n What happened?\n\n\nD-3481:\n I flipped the switch and lightning came out of the control panel and hit Thomas and now he's not moving and I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to I swear! It just missed me and, and\u2014\n\n\nKoullette:\n Deep breaths. I need you to breathe.\n\n\nD-3481:\n Right\u2026 deep breaths.\n\n\nKoullette:\n Is Thomas alive?\n\n\nD-3481:\n I think so. He's looking at me.\n\n\nKoullette:\n I'm deploying a medical team down there at once. Did anything else happen?\n\n\nD-3481:\n Umm\u2026 the lights. The lights in one of the tunnels went out.\n\n\nKoullette:\n Which tunnel?\n\n\nD-3481:\n The one we entered through? I think? They all look the same. I don't know.\n\n\nKoullette:\n 3481, I need you to calm down. We're coming to get you and Thomas right now.\n\n\nD-3481:\n How long?\n\n\nKoullette:\n Approximately eight hours.\n\n\n\n\nD-3481:\n Ok\u2026 ok.\n\n\nKoullette:\n Please relay that to Thomas.\n\n\nD-3481:\n Ok.\n\n\nKoullette:\n And remember, deep breaths.\n\n\n<\nEnd Log\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin Log\n>\n\n\nKoullette:\n Hey, 3481, are you still there?\n\n\nD-3481:\n Yeah.\n\n\nKoullette:\n I have an update on the medical team. They reached the entrance to the tunnels.\n\n\nD-3481:\n That's good to hear.\n\n\nKoullette:\n Well\u2026 there's a problem. The door is shut. We're trying to figure out how to open it safely.\n\n\nD-3481:\n It's closed?\n\n\nKoullette:\n Yeah. Unfortunately, since we're working in the lower levels of the facility, we're limited in our options. We can't just blow up all of sub-level 39.\n\n\nD-3481:\n So, we're trapped?\n\n\nKoullette:\n We're going to get you out, but I don't know how long.\n\n\nD-3481:\n We're trapped\u2026\n\n\nKoullette:\n I know I've been telling you this a lot, but deep breaths. I need you to stay with me on this.\n\n\nD-3481:\n Ok.\n\n\nKoullette:\n In Thomas' pack there should be a binder full of testing information. Can you find that for me?\n\n\nScuffling noises are heard.\n\n\nD-3481:\n Ok. Found it.\n\n\nKoullette:\n I need you to read through all of that. We may need you to continue testing.\n\n\nD-3481:\n Me?\n\n\nKoullette:\n Yes. You. And don't forget to ration out your food. We shouldn't take too long but, just in case.\n\n\n<\nEnd Log\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Documentation\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite-19 Sublevel 39 Schematics Overview\n\n\n[LEVEL-3 CLASSIFIED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5003 Re-Entry Attempts\n\n\n[LEVEL-3 CLASSIFIED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 5003-T.14 Ethics Committee Minutes\n\n\n[LEVEL-4 CLASSIFIED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-5003\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0Day\u00a0#2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0SCP-5003\u00a0Testing\u00a0Log\u00a0Day\u00a0#2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nBegin Log\n>\n\n\nKoullette:\n 3481, you there?\n\n\nD-3481:\n Yeah.

        "< Begin Log > Recording begins. There is a light humming noise in the background. DeWalt: Raven, can you hear us? Koullette: Loud and clear Thomas. I assume you're ready to start testing? DeWalt: Wouldn't have contacted you any earlier. Ready Charles? D-3481: I guess. Koullette: Alright, let's get this show on the road. DeWalt: Charles, can you flip switch 1-A? D-3481: Umm\u2026 which one is that? DeWalt: It's the blue one over on your left. D-3481: Oh. Ok. The humming stops. A scream is heard, followed by a repeated crackling noise. After a few moments the humming returns. Koullette: What happened? Are you ok? Silence. Koullette: Thomas? D-3481: I\u2014 I'm still here. D-3481 is breathing erratically. Koullette: What happened? D-3481: I flipped the switch and lightning came out of the control panel and hit Thomas and now he's not moving and I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to I swear! It just missed me and, and\u2014 Koullette: Deep breaths. I need you to breathe. D-3481: Right\u2026 deep breaths. Koullette: Is Thomas alive? D-3481: I think so. He's looking at me. Koullette: I'm deploying a medical team down there at once. Did anything else happen? D-3481: Umm\u2026 the lights. The lights in one of the tunnels went out. Koullette: Which tunnel? D-3481: The one we entered through? I think? They all look the same. I don't know. Koullette: 3481, I need you to calm down. We're coming to get you and Thomas right now. D-3481: How long? Koullette: Approximately eight hours. D-3481: Ok\u2026 ok. Koullette: Please relay that to Thomas. D-3481: Ok. Koullette: And remember, deep breaths. < End Log >",
        "< Begin Log > Koullette: Hey, 3481, are you still there? D-3481: Yeah. Koullette: I have an update on the medical team. They reached the entrance to the tunnels. D-3481: That's good to hear. Koullette: Well\u2026 there's a problem. The door is shut. We're trying to figure out how to open it safely. D-3481: It's closed? Koullette: Yeah. Unfortunately, since we're working in the lower levels of the facility, we're limited in our options. We can't just blow up all of sub-level 39. D-3481: So, we're trapped? Koullette: We're going to get you out, but I don't know how long. D-3481: We're trapped\u2026 Koullette: I know I've been telling you this a lot, but deep breaths. I need you to stay with me on this. D-3481: Ok. Koullette: In Thomas' pack there should be a binder full of testing information. Can you find that for me? Scuffling noises are heard. D-3481: Ok. Found it. Koullette: I need you to read through all of that. We may need you to continue testing. D-3481: Me? Koullette: Yes. You. And don't forget to ration out your food.

Have you and Thomas eaten yet? D-3481: Yeah. Yeah we ate. Koullette: Everything else going ok? D-3481: Not really. Couldn't sleep last night. Koullette: Any reason why? D-3481: I couldn't stop thinking about the tunnel where the lights went out. Koullette: That sounds\u2026 rough. D-3481: Have you opened the door yet? Koullette: I'm afraid not. D-3481: Fuck! Koullette: I know it's frustrating but\u2014 D-3481: I don't want to die down here! Koullette: Just deep breaths. Please. D-3481: Stop telling me that! There's only so much oxygen down here, right? I can't waste it! Koullette: Would you like to know how much oxygen you probably have? D-3481: Fine! Koullette: A decade. At least. D-3481: \u2026 Oh.

Koullette: I've been there before. It's nice. D-3481: Yeah. Yeah it is. A lot of open space. Mountains are pretty. Koullette: Blue sky. D-3481: Yeah. Blue sky. Koullette: If you're able to help me out, I promise you, you'll see that sky again. But I need you to be calm, and with me. Understand? D-3481: I\u2026 I understand. Koullette: Good. Now, please, get started on those tests. D-3481: Ok. < End Log >",

D-3481: He's been looking down the tunnel that has no lights. Just\u2026 just staring. It's so dark down there. I've moved to the other side of the room so he's further away from it, but I don't think that helped. Koullette: Well, tell him we're coming. D-3481: I will.

There's berry bushes growing out of the walls. Koullette: Berry bushes? D-3481: Yeah. Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. Koullette: This is the same tunnel you and Thomas entered through, right? D-3481: They weren't there before. Koullette: That's\u2026 interesting. You sure they're regular berries? D-3481: They look normal. Koullette: Ok. Well, more food is a good thing I guess. It'll probably be easier to feed Thomas the berries than the rations. D-3481: Probably, yeah. Koullette: How's he holding up? D-3481: Thomas is\u2026 fine? I guess? Koullette: Fine? D-3481: Like, he's still paralyzed. But nothing else. Koullette: I see\u2026 D-3481: I'm going to uh\u2026 get back to testing.

I'm talking about your test results. D-3481: Makes no difference to me really. Koullette: Are you sure you're following the directions in the binder? D-3481: Yeah. Koullette: Well, it's just that according to your last batch, the power output of the source hasn't changed much since the first day. D-3481: Is that bad? Koullette: No it's just\u2014You're sure? D-3481: Positive. I even double checked the connections between the multimeter and powerlines 5-G and 11-D this morning. Koullette: Oh. D-3481: Surprised?
