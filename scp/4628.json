SCP-4628-2 are to wear protective airtight suits at all times. SCP-4628-2 are to attend mandatory remedial and reversal classes. If an accident results in a gross loss of mass to an SCP-4628-2, Site 17 Kitchen Staff are required to be able to reproduce SCP-4628-1 for reintegration.\n\n\nPreventive action \"Operation Pi Day\n1\n\" is to be conducted every March 14.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4628-1 is a type of pie crust made with an anomalous recipe titled \u201cPi Crust for Dummies\u201d. When SCP-4628-1 is ingested, the subject will transform into a pliable light brown entity composed of a mixture of butter, flour, salt, and water similar in consistency to unbaked pie crust. Entities are collectively known as SCP-4628-2. SCP-4628-1\u2019s anomaly only affects humans who have been exposed to the idea of the circle constant pi. Subjects with the belief that pi is inelegant are unaffected. SCP-4628-1's effects are reversible. See Document #: 4628-A1 Reversal Procedure.\n\n\nSCP-4628-2 retain sapience, speech, and the mass of their original person. SCP-4628-2 do not need to perform any human bodily functions. SCP-4628-2 exposed to the air for long periods of time show signs of staleness associated with pie dough and air exposure. Extended exposure may result in loss of mass via crumbling. SCP-4628-2 can also lose mass via friction, trauma, or contact with other SCP-4628-2. When an SCP-4628-2 is reduced to about 20% of its mass, it will lose sentience. Warped speech and slow vocalizations are signs of an SCP-4628-2 losing too much mass. Separated mass can be reintegrated into an SCP-4628-2's body. SCP-4628-1 also works as a substitute if the lost mass is unrecoverable.\n\n\n\n\nDocument #: 4628-A1\n Reversal Procedure\n\n\nTo reverse the effects of SCP-4628-1, an SCP-4628-2 must be able to reason why pi as a concept of geometry and trigonometry is aesthetically displeasing or inefficient. To achieve this, SCP-4628 are required to attend remedial and reversal classes. Remedial classes begin with Introduction to Geometry, Area, and Unit Squares and any necessary supplementary lessons. SCP-4628 are required to pass remedial classes to qualify for reversal classes. Reversal classes include teachings from \n\u03c0\n is Wrong! by Bob Palais, The Tau Manifesto by Michael Hartl, and the Pi Is (still) Wrong series by Victoria Hart. Average SCP-4628-2 can reverse within 1 month of containment under the Foundation curriculum. Special cases have been under remedial classes for upwards of 6 months. An SCP-4628-2 that has reversed but has its preference against pi amnesticized reverts to anomalous dough form.\n\n\n\n\nDocument #: 4628-A2\n Discovery\n\n\nThe Foundation has been aware of SCP-4628-1 and SCP-4628-2 since its first recorded outbreak on March 14, 2002. The process to reverse SCP-4628-1's anomalous effects as well as its origin came to Foundation awareness three months after the first SCP-4628-2 were contained. On June 28, 2002, an envelope manifested on Anomalous Mathematics researcher Sedric Felizardo\u2019s desk at Site 17. Inside was a letter revealing SCP-4628-1's recipe's author, the author's motives, and how to reverse SCP-4628-1's effects. Along with the letter was a separate document detailing the complete recipe of SCP-4628-1. Testing of reversal procedures was approved immediately after receiving this information. Successful reversal tests led to the implementation of the current containment and reversal procedures. SCP-4628-1's recipe was theorized to have been leaked by its author to the anomalous black-market channels shortly after this development.\n\n\n\n\nDocument #: 4628-A3\n Letter addressed to researcher Felizardo on June 28, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Level\u00a02\u00a0Clearance\u00a0Required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Accepted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Sedric,\n\n\n\n\nFuck pi.\n\nWhat a joke of a circle constant.\n\n\n\nMath is supposed to be easy, beautiful, \nelegant.\n\nPi makes math look \nugly.\n\n\n\nDefinition: a circle is a collection of all points a given distance away from a center.\n\nA radius pointing forth like a taut string in the sand.\n\n\n\nIt draws a curved path as far as its shadow in the sun will take it.\n\nYou watch it spin and marvel at its simple beauty,\n\n\n\nand the crashing waves,\n\nand the sea birds' calls,\n\nand your lover in your arms.\n\n\n\nBut Archimedes said \n\"fuck the radius!\"\n\n\nPi\n is the ratio of a circle\u2019s \ndiameter\n to its circumference.\n\n\nDiameter??

Pi Day is a celebration of the circle constant pi held by enthusiasts every March 14 since 1988. This date references pi\u2019s first three digits, 3.14. The celebration is marked by the consumption of pie due to its coincidentally circular nature and play on words.\n\n\n2\n.

        "Dear Sedric, Fuck pi. What a joke of a circle constant. Math is supposed to be easy, beautiful, elegant. Pi makes math look ugly. Definition: a circle is a collection of all points a given distance away from a center. A radius pointing forth like a taut string in the sand. It draws a curved path as far as its shadow in the sun will take it. You watch it spin and marvel at its simple beauty, and the crashing waves, and the sea birds' calls, and your lover in your arms. But Archimedes said \"fuck the radius!\" Pi is the ratio of a circle\u2019s diameter to its circumference. Diameter?? Who fucking cares about diameters Archimedes?? Maybe if you need to jump over a fucking pit, BUT NOT IN THE HUMAN RACE'S THEORETICAL SPACE OF MATH. Fuck diameters. A circle is defined by its radius, not its diameter. Why the fuck is the circle constant based on the diameter? Why is 1 \u03c0 in radians a half circle? Who cares about half circles? Why is a whole circle 2 \u03c0 radians? NO. UNNECESSARY CONVERSIONS ARE UGLY. ONE PIE SHOULD BE ONE PI. No one cares. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll need a correct circle constant in the real world. I care. I know you care too. Every March 14th is agony. Pi is fucking wrong. I\u2019m sorry Sedric. I got angry. I made the pie. I promise the people don\u2019t feel any pain. I just need them to learn. If they learn the truth, the true circle constant , only then can they be forgiven. Fuck pi. Fuck Pi Day. Fuck Archimedes. Fuck this world. I\u2019m fixing it. - All my love, Adam I\u2019m still here for you .",
