Once a day, janitorial staff are to retrieve any paper attached to this case for recycling purposes.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5166 is a small notebook with illegible text written on its surface in pencil.\n\n\nAt variable intervals, scraps of paper similar in appearance to SCP-5166 will appear stuck to any object in its immediate vicinity. To date, these objects have included:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5166's containment unit.\n\n\nInstruments being used to inspect SCP-5166.\n\n\nPersonnel inspecting SCP-5166.\n\n\nVermin passing SCP-5166's containment unit\n1\n.\n\n\nItself.\n\n\nScraps of paper created by itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the illegible writing present on SCP-5166, legible writing is present on the additional paper scraps it creates. This writing invariably takes the form of a supposed message from an individual or group claiming responsibility for the creation of the object the paper is stuck to, along with an explanation for where the object came from or what its purpose is. Without exception, all of these explanations to date have been incorrect.\n\n\nSCP-5166 was purchased by Agent Green during his annual mandated attendance of the Andersen Auction of Abnormalities in Yorkshire, England. A full list of anomalies which were brought into containment at this time is available in the Site-22 archives.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5166-1 (Message Log):\n\n\nThe following is a record of the messages that have appeared on objects in proximity to SCP-5166. Any additional messages produced by SCP-5166 are to be submitted to research staff for archival purposes prior to recycling.\n\n\n\n\nObject:\n An empty coffee cup.\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE INTERSTELLAR CABAL ARCHIVES\n\n\nWEAPON ULTRA 646:\n \"The Heat Catcher\"\n\n\nPURPOSE:\n The Heat Catcher is the ultimate weapon our thought-scientists have produced in our endless war against the Void Demons. It is capable of absorbing all heat within a star into its basin, firing said heat into the metaphysical realm and obliterating its foe.\n\n\nWe thought that nothing could stand against us while we had this behemoth \u2026 but the Void Demons were too strong.\n\n\nBeware! They are coming for your planet now! Argh!
