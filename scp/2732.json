Dating inconclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2732\n\n\nObject Class:\n Safe\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-2732 is to be kept at \nStorage Site-\u2588\u2588\n in a standard large object containment chamber. SCP-2732-1 is to be stored separately in a security safe with controlled heat and humidity, due to its delicate nature. SCP-2732-2-D instances are to be kept in a cold storage chamber.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2732 is a wooden Beijing Opera stage, constructed within the last century. SCP-2732 lacks a backstage area or stairs. SCP-2732-1 is a Ming Dynasty Era booklet containing seven entries, all different accounts of the same event.\n\n\nWhen a human subject reads out a whole entry directly from SCP-2732-1 while standing within a 60-meter radius of SCP-2732, SCP-2732-2 instances, along with stage props required, will manifest on the stage. SCP-2732-2 instances are autonomous, mostly wooden mannequins with no facial features wearing Beijing Opera costumes and facial makeup. SCP-2732-2 instances will engage in a performance\n1\n that seems to correspond to the entry read, accompanied by music with no apparent source. See Addendum for specifics and exceptions.\n\n\nWhen a human being enters SCP-2732, the performance will halt, with SCP-2732-2 instances ceasing all motions. SCP-2732-2 instances and stage props removed at this time will behave like ordinary objects. The performance will resume after all objects taken from SCP-2732 are returned and all human subjects have left the stage. After the performance, SCP-2732-2 instances and stage props will disappear, except for the instance generated by Entry 7. See Addendum for more information.\n\n\nAddendum:\n The following is the content of SCP-2732-1, and the specifics of SCP-2732-2's performance corresponding to each entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry 1\n\n\nEntry 2\n\n\nEntry 3\n\n\nEntry 4\n\n\nEntry 5\n\n\nEntry 6\n\n\nEntry 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u963f\u4f3d\u4e4b\u738b\uff0c\u7f22\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\n\n\nThe king of Ajia was hanged dead.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Log:\n SCP-2732-2-A first appears in this entry.
