Elliot was reported missing on the night of October 31st, 1960, after his treehouse was found ransacked. A switchblade belonging to one Jonathan Regis, a local fourteen-year-old named as a suspect in the disappearance by local police, was discovered in a cookie tin within the treehouse\u2019s wreckage. No other anomalous properties were observed within the well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4927\n | SCP-4928 | \nSCP-4929\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4928\n\" by Dyslexion, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
