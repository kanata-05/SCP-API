Any SCP-3683 instances seen leaving the city are to be repeatedly killed on sight and the remains either taken for study or incinerated.\n\n\nMTF Gamma-119 (\"Air Superiority\") is operating as a pest control Foundation front company, and is tasked with maintaining anti-pigeon structures, enforcing proper trash disposal, and exterminating all birds within the city until SCP-3683 reaches a population small enough to contain completely.\n\n\nAt the Regional Director's discretion, anomalous technology and SCP objects may be used to cull SCP-3683's population. Under no circumstances are any sentient or anomalous avian entities to come within 100\u00a0km of Syracuse, NY.\n\n\nThe event of \nSCP-514\n or sentient avian species entering the quarantine zone is projected to lead to an SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario within 5 years, and is to be avoided at all costs.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3683 is a hostile, anomalous subspecies of pigeon (\nColumba livia anomalis\n) currently infesting Syracuse, NY.\n\n\nSCP-3683 are large, omnivorous birds, with wingspans ranging from 1.5-7\u00a0m. SCP-3683 superficially resemble proportionally scaled common rock pigeons, but most instances have random feather patterns common to other birds. The birds also have rudimentary teeth lining their beaks and throats.\n\n\nSCP-3683 typically scavenges in trash like nonanomalous pigeons; however, older and larger instances are known to hunt and carry away small animals like other birds, rodents, cats, and small dogs.\n\n\nSCP-3683 instances burst into a small group of visually normal rock pigeons when killed or cornered. If allowed to escape, some of these pigeons will recombine to form a new SCP-3683 instance. Small pigeons need not originate from the same SCP-3683 instance to reconstitute; the new instance will possess a mixture of characteristics from all of the progenitors.\n\n\nSCP-3683 cannot reproduce with each other but are capable of reproducing with most other bird species, despite any expected biological or logistical barriers. Eggs produced this way hatch up to 6 times more rapidly than usual for the non-SCP-3683 bird species. The new hatchlings often exhibit traits, biological features, or instincts present in the foreign species.\n\n\nDue to SCP-3683's dispersal and recombination properties, these adaptations can spread very quickly through the population. For example, the first known mating with a hummingbird resulted in approximately 70% of SCP-3683 instances becoming capable of hovering and reverse flight within one month.\n\n\nIntel from MTF Gamma-119 indicates SCP-3683 instances have eliminated corvids from the city and have begun using complex tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3682\n | SCP-3683 | \nSCP-3684\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3683\n\" by Weryllium, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
