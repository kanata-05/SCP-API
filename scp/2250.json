This has so far been effective in allowing the Central Alabama Field Unit to operate without hindrance from government agencies or environmental groups.\n\n\nCivilians witnessing SCP-2250 in any form are to be detained and supplied with Class-B amnestics. Should these civilians have lost their dog to SCP-2250, they are to be supplied with a suitable replacement and led to believe it is the original.\n\n\nAny research with the goal of partially or fully deciphering the language or communication used by susceptible species of waterfowl is to be covertly disrupted in any way possible.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2250 is a memetic contagion currently exclusively affecting various species of waterfowl\n1\n in and around Bloch Park in Selma, AL.\n\n\nTests to determine the vector of infection for this memetic contagion have yielded evidence that SCP-2250 is spread between waterfowl through inter-species communication and vocalization; those waterfowl prevented from vocalizing were unable to create new instances of SCP-2250, and those deafened showed no signs of infection. Once exposed to SCP-2250's memetic triggers, susceptible waterfowl will be subject to SCP-2250 activation events at intermittent times.\n\n\nThe animals involved are not innately anomalous, but are subject to SCP-2250 activation events during which they should be treated as such. When an SCP-2250 activation event occurs, the affected animal becomes an SCP-2250-1 instance. It will cease movement, open its beak, and produce a series of sounds in the 25 - 32\u00a0kHz range. Canines within a range of up to 2\u00a0km show a general tendency to move towards the point of origin for these sounds, though not all canines act on this impulse. Those animals approaching affected waterfowl and entering a radius of approximately 2\u00a0m are prone to being trapped by SCP-2250-2.\n\n\nSCP-2250-2 are darkly colored tentacles with an average diameter of approximately 3\u00a0mm, and composed of a tissue with a genetic makeup bearing close resemblance to that of the Pacific lugworm (\nAbarenicola pacifica\n). These emerge from an SCP-2250-1 specimen's beak once a canine approaches to within circa 2\u00a0m. SCP-2250-2 can typically reach beyond this range if necessary, with an as-of-yet undetermined upper limit. Having emerged, SCP-2250-2 instances will wrap around their prey and exert up to 800\u00a0N of force in order to pull it towards SCP-2250-1.\n\n\nOnce close enough, canines trapped by SCP-2250-2 are swallowed whole by SCP-2250-1. This usually occurs despite the clear discrepancy between the range of motion for SCP-2250-1's beak and the dimensions of the canine involved. Observations have not yielded a concrete explanation for this phenomenon, with video logs simply showing the canines disappearing into the beak whole, without apparently suffering damage to their physical form. All SCP-2250-2 then retract into SCP-2250-1, which will remain motionless and unreactive to any form of stimuli throughout the entire process. Despite this invasive process and the potential for extensive physical trauma, SCP-2250-1 instances are not harmed during this process.\n\n\nOnce swallowed, prey does not travel down the esophagus, instead disappearing from SCP-2250-1 altogether. Attempts to track test subjects have almost exclusively yielded a location approximately 6.2\u00a0km beneath the island of Moloka'i\n2\n. Attempts to reach this location have as of yet proven fruitless.\n\n\nIn one incident, the location returned was in the Pelican Nebula. However, there is no conceivable way a GPS signal could be picked up from that location, nor should it have been able to travel back to earth within the timeframe given.\n\n\nIf not fully destroyed, an SCP-2250-1 instance will remain motionless for a period of up to 2 hours, after which it will regurgitate the partially digested remains of the previously ingested canine. SCP-2250-1 will then revert to its non-anomalous state, showing signs of extreme distress and often trying to flee the immediate area. Remains of prey are covered in a high-viscosity fluid containing brine, digestive enzymes, mucus, glycoproteins and electrolytes.\n\n\nTests using adult human subjects placed within range of an SCP-2250-1 during an activation event have not produced results. It is possible that these tests could provoke SCP-2250-2 emergence if performed using subjects of a smaller stature, but no such tests are currently planned.\n\n\nAddendum 2250/A/01:\n \nTranscript of initial 911 call - d.d. 20130314\n\n\n\n\nCall initiated at 9:13 PM, 03-14-2013\n\n\nDispatcher:\n \"Selma 911.
