Access to SCP-4489 is to be granted only with permission from the Site-81 research authority.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4489 is a small, carved wooden statue of a cartoon hobo. Individuals exposed to SCP-4489 in close proximity will gradually begin to express feelings of guilt, often as a result of minor or non-existent slights they feel that they have somehow inflicted on those around them. Prolonged exposure to SCP-4489 often leads to such inflated feelings of guilt and regret that the subject becomes inconsolable or otherwise impossible to interact with until SCP-4489 is removed.\n\n\nSubjects typically return to a baseline behavior after SCP-4489 has been removed, time depending on the length of time exposed.\n\n\nAddendum 4489.1:\n Testing Log\n\n\nFor testing purposes, SCP-4489 was set on a table in the center of a standard testing chamber. Subjects were then exposed to SCP-4489 in various scenarios and for various lengths of time.\n\n\n\n\nCONTROL Test Log 4489.1.0\n\n\nSite-81\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4489 is set on a table in the middle of a testing chamber. D-91411 introduced to the testing chamber for a period of 5 minutes.\n\n\nOutcome:\n D-91411 is removed from the chamber after 5 minutes. Subject apologizes for being such a boring test subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4489.1.1\n\n\nSite-81\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4489 is set on a table in the middle of a testing chamber. D-95641 introduced to the testing chamber for a period of 20 minutes.\n\n\nOutcome:\n D-95641 is removed from the chamber after 20 minutes. D-95641 weeps openly upon extraction, stating that she \"didn't mean to breathe so much in there but it just couldn't be helped\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4489.1.2\n\n\nSite-81\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4489 is set on a table in the middle of a testing chamber. D-98446 introduced to the testing chamber for a period of 1 hour.\n\n\nOutcome:\n D-98446 must be physically removed from the chamber and is inconsolable for several hours afterwards. Once D-98446 is sufficiently calmed, he apologizes profusely for \"having to pee so bad\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Log 4489.1.3\n\n\nSite-81\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4489 is set on a table in the middle of a testing chamber. D-84544 and D-91101 introduced to the testing chamber for a period of 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nTEST AUDIO RECORDING TRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\nD-91101 and D-84544 enter containment chamber. After a few moments, SCP-4489 is brought into the chamber and sat on a table.\n\n\nD-91101:\n So what now? We just sit here?\n\n\nDr. Brannaugh:\n Yep. You just sit there.\n\n\nD-84544:\n Got it.\n\n\nEight seconds pass.\n\n\nD-84544:\n Hey, buddy.\n\n\nD-91101:\n Yeah guy?\n\n\nD-84544:\n Look, I just wanted to apologize for getting all up in your space right now. I shouldn't be doing that.\n\n\nNote: D-84544 and D-91101 are currently more than 3m apart.\n\n\nD-91101:\n Oh, God, you don't need to apologize to me, man. I'm sorry for making you feel like you were in my space. You're not in my space; if anything, I'm in \nyour\n space.\n\n\nD-84544:\n No, oh man, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you didn't know what your space was, or whether I was in it, honestly. I hope you can forgive me, please.\n\n\nD-91101:\n (\nTears begin to form in the subject's eyes\n) Oh no, I can't believe I've done this to you. I can't believe I put you in a position where you felt like you needed to apologize to me for an implication that I misread. I'm so sorry pal, I didn't mean to hurt you this way. I'll get out of your space now.\n\n\nD-91101 moves to the corner of the containment cell. D-84544 bursts into tears and collapses to the ground.\n\n\nD-84544:\n (\nThrough tears\n) No- I- I'm so- I'm so sorry you- you felt like- like you had to walk all that way just- just to satisfy my- my- my unreasonable space needs- I'm sorry- (\nsniff\n) Please for- forgive me. (\nWeeps openly\n)\n\n\nD-91101:\n No! I'm sorry for what I've done to you! It was my actions that reduced you to this! I am to blame! I'm sorry!\n\n\nD-84544:\n (\nCrawling to the opposite corner of the room\n) Wh-what? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over- over the sound of- of- of my own distracting- sobbing.\n\n\nD-91101:\n (\nShouting and weeping\n) OH GOD PLEASE NO WHY DO I DO THIS TO PEOPLE, I'M SO SORRY FOR INCONVENIENCING YOU LIKE THIS BY NOT PROPERLY ARTICULATING. I'M SO SORRY.\n\n\nD-84544:\n I'm- I'm sorry my- my ears are so- so- (\nsobs\n) so dysfunctional.\n\n\nD-91101:\n I'M SORRY MY INADEQUACIES HAVE PUT THIS EAR DOUBT UPON YOU, YOUR EARS ARE FINE AND I AM AT FAULT FOR BEING SUCH AN OBNOXIOUS, INARTICULATE BUFFOON.\n\n\nD-84544:\n It- it- it was my hideous visage that- that did this to you, please- (\nturns to face into the corner\n) please let me sp- spare you my horrible face. I'm s-s-sorry I am so hideous.\n\n\nD-91101:\n PLEASE, PLEASE LET ME APOLOGIZE FOR SHOULDERING YOU WITH THIS INSURMOUNTABLE AND MISPLACED SELF-DOUBT. I AM THE ONE WITH THE HIDEOUS FACE. (\nTurns to face corner\n) PLEASE FORGIVE ME, MY SOUL CANNOT HANDLE THIS GREAT REGRET I FEEL FOR HARMING YOU IN THIS WAY.\n\n\nD-84544:\n My entire life exists only to- to- to be a mockery of a just existence. (\nInconsolable sobbing\n)\n\n\n\n\nAfter an additional two minutes of D-84544 and D-91101 screaming apologies into the corners of the testing chamber, both subjects are removed and SCP-4489 is returned to storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4488\n | SCP-4489 | \nSCP-4490\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-4489\n\" by djkaktus, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
