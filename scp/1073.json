A colony of SCP-1073-2 is currently contained in a hermetically sealed containment unit in Sector-\u2588\u2588's Storage Site-\u2588. Any personnel with sufficient security clearance are free to converse with SCP-1073-2.\n\n\n3/9/ \u2588\u2588:\n Because of good behavior a small radio transmitter broadcasting on the frequency \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 AM has been set up across from 1073's containment unit and is to continuously play audio tapes of various novels and non-fiction works.\n\n\n8/23/ \u2588\u2588:\n 1073-2 has taken an interest in history and mathematics; pending O5 approval, more of these texts will be added to the playlist.\n\n\n9/7/ \u2588\u2588:\n Approved - \nO5-3\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1073-1 is a clear liquid identical in appearance and physical properties (conductivity, boiling and freezing point) to water with a 0.9 M concentration of H\n2\nSO\n4\n (sulfuric acid), from a pool inside a cave in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mountains. Chemical analysis reveals that the liquid is actually [DATA EXPUNGED], and shows traces of dissolved silicon dioxide and long-chain silanes. Investigation into the possible industrial and military applications of the chemical are ongoing.\n\n\nSCP-1073-2 is a sapient colony of silicon-based microbes with a structure similar to that of primitive computers. 1073's structure allows it to receive and decipher radio waves, \nresearch into military applications is ongoing\n. So far five distinct \"species\" of SCP-1073-2 have been observed. \"Gatherers\", as the name suggests, gather up raw materials and irreparably damaged colony members, for use as food and in reproduction. \"CPUs\" perform all the higher functions for the colony, including communication and digestion. \"MMUs\" access information from the memory cells (both ROM and RAM) and transfer it to the \"CPUs\". \"ROMs\" (read only memory) act as the colony's DNA, containing all the information required for reproduction, communication and certain long term memories. \"RAMs\" (random access memory) contain the colony's short term memories. After a variable period of time information is either copied from the RAM cells to the ROM cells or deleted. During 1073-2's stay with the Foundation the number of ROM cells has increased by a factor of 10\n4\n.\n\n\nTesting log:\n\n\n\n\nTest number:\n 1073-01\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-1073-1 and 2\n\n\nTest:\n Freezing\n\n\nResult:\n Subjects were thawed out with minimal damage, but described the experience as unpleasant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest number:\n 1073-02\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-1073-1 and 2\n\n\nTest:\n Boiling\n\n\nResult:\n When vaporized SCP-1073-1 reacts violently with [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in substantial damage to the containment cell and the deaths of three (3) Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest number:\n 1073-03\n\n\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-1073-2, distilled water.\n\n\nTest:\n Habitat change\n\n\nResult:\n Immediately upon introduction to the water SCP-1073-2 began to fall apart. Further testing indicates that 1073-1 is required to maintain the silicon triple bond that is the backbone of SCP-1073-2.\n\n\n\n\nWhen in an active state waves are produced from the center of the liquid every three (3) to five (5) seconds and travel outward in a circular shape. Following the initial recovery in 19\u2588\u2588 it was believed that the waves were meaningless until Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an amateur radio operator, found that the small waves (averaging eight (8) cm in diameter) and the large waves (averaging sixteen (16) cm in diameter) respectively correspond to the dots and dashes of Morse code.\n\n\nUntil his death in 1993 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 carried out weekly interviews with SCP-1073 using a self-built radio broadcasting set.

    "description": "SCP-1073-1 is a clear liquid identical in appearance and physical properties (conductivity, boiling and freezing point) to water with a 0.9 M concentration of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), from a pool inside a cave in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mountains. Chemical analysis reveals that the liquid is actually [DATA EXPUNGED], and shows traces of dissolved silicon dioxide and long-chain silanes. Investigation into the possible industrial and military applications of the chemical are ongoing.",
