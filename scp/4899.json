Dedicated satellites are to remain in high Earth orbit, intercepting, recording, and scrambling any transmissions that come from SCP-4899 to resemble cosmic background radiation.\n\n\nFoundation operatives embedded within radio-based observatories are to prevent the observation of SCP-4899, as well as the reception of any transmissions from the object. Amnestics (up to Class-C) may be administered if necessary.\n\n\nRecorded transmissions from SCP-4899 may be beamed to Lunar Area-32 for decoding and storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREVISION\n\nFollowing Incident 4899-R, SCP-4899 has been upgraded to Keter classification. SCP-4899 has since stopped broadcasting any transmissions. As of this time, no means exist to properly contain SCP-4899.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4899 is a celestial object approximately 144 light-years from Earth. The object emits no visible light, instead broadcasting radio waves. Interestingly, Foundation observation via spacecraft augmented with temporal sinks has revealed that SCP-4899 is specifically broadcasting to Earth, with no other known areas of reception.\n\n\nSCP-4899\u2019s transmissions normally include footage of Earth, although the quality of these transmissions is abnormally high for such a distance. Furthermore, rather than being delayed by the speed of light, the object\u2019s broadcasts take place in real time, indicating that SCP-4899, or its creators, have access to faster-than-light technology.\n\n\nSince its discovery, SCP-4899 has been transmitting increasingly more \"aware\" footage of Earth, switching from no recognizable pattern of locations to metropolitan areas in 18\u2588\u2588, to national military bases in 19\u2588\u2588, to the locations of various heads of state in 19\u2588\u2588, and finally to Foundation areas and sites in 20\u2588\u2588. How SCP-4899 has been able to identify Foundation areas based entirely on external observation is currently unknown.\n\n\nAdditionally, approximately half an hour after every transmission is intercepted, some sort of calamity will occur within the location captured by SCP-4899. These calamities range from small fires, to entire containment breaches. As more images have been transmitted by SCP-4899, the scale of these disasters has steadily increased.\n\n\nSome of SCP-4899\u2019s transmissions can be found below.\n\n\nAddendum 4899-T:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Access\u00a0Addendum\u00a04899-T\u00a0(Clearance\u00a03/4899\u00a0required)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Credentials\u00a0Approved.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are a series of still images (taken from video footage) transmitted to Earth by SCP-4899.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroom Lake AFB, an American military installation in Nevada. 34 minutes after this image was decoded, a building collapse occured, causing \u2588 casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite 66. 29 minutes after receiving this image, a fire broke out in the eastern wing, leading to evacuation of 30% of the site and \u2588 casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage Site 64. 36 minutes after this transmission was intercepted, an earthquake originating approximately 3 miles away caused \u2588\u2588 casualties in the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea 6. 28 minutes after the broadcast was decoded, a containment breach resulted in the termination of \u2588\u2588 personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea 96. 40 minutes after this image was intercepted, [REDACTED] causing \u2588\u2588 casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceived \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.
