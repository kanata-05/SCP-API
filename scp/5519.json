Further evidence of current SCP-5519-1 instances are to be investigated immediately, and information related to the composition and methods of creating SCP-5519-1 are to be considered the top priority when testing with existing SCP-5519-1 instances.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5519 is the official designation of a TK-Class Casual Restructuring Event, which most likely took place from 11/4/21 to 14/4/21. The effects of reality-based anomalies are usually impossible to determine, specifically what aspects of fundamental reality were damaged or replaced. However, the existence of SCP-5519-1 suggests that SCP-5519 was localized to a very small subdivision of physical matter. Investigations into the full extent and effects of SCP-5519 are ongoing.\n\n\nSCP-5519-1 is material that has evidently survived SCP-5519, and has extensive properties:\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0SCP-5519\u00a0Documented\u00a0Traits\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0[CLOSE\u00a0FILE]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5519-1 is an off-white, oblong cylinder, approximately a foot in length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5519-1 is noticeably moist, and residue from SCP-5519-1 will remain on substances or organisms that have come into contact with SCP-5519-1 for extended periods of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5519-1\u2019s exterior is hard to the touch, although additional force causes its interior structure to buckle rapidly, giving the appearance of a dent where pressure was applied.

Several seconds pass, and the presumed owner of SCP-5519-2 is seen opening their door to greet the officer.\n\n\nTransportation Officer:\n Hello sir, I\u2019ve got your order right here.\n\n\nThe officer sets down the stack of crates, and removes the top box before handing it to the other humanoid. The logo of an orange disc with a beige outline is visible on the crates, possibly a symbol representing high status and influence.\n\n\nReceiving Individual:\n Thank God, you got here just in time. The game\u2019s almost started, and the fam was starting to get rowdy.\n\n\nDue to the mention of a theological figure, it is suspected that either the act of delivery or the contents of these crates possessed religious or ritual significance.\n\n\nTransportation Officer:\n Yeah, there was a bit of a wreck on 285, so that took a bit more time.\n\n\nThe receiving individual opens the swinging lid of the crate, revealing an additional SCP-5519-1 instance.\n\n\nReceiving Individual:\n Alright, and the others?\n\n\nOver the course of the next minute, the officer identifies the contents of the crates, and hands them over to the individual after the contents of the crates are described. Notably, various clear cylinders are visible, evidently containing bubbling liquid.\n\n\nTransportation Officer:\n And there\u2019s the last of the garlic bread.\n\n\nAt this moment, the footage ends. The phrase \u201cBe Careful What You Wish For\u201d is visible on the screen for a very brief amount of time before cutting to black.\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nResearch into SCP-5519-1\u2019s former status as \u201cGarlic Bread\u201d is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5518\n | SCP-5519 | \nSCP-5520\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5519\n\" by Kensing, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
