The strength of this filter, however, reduces to almost zero whenever the instance is engaging in acts that would be considered criminal or otherwise socially inappropriate\n1\n.\n\n\nDespite what most SCP-5190 instances believe, the majority of their personal relationships reach the level of acquaintance at best \u2014 when pressed, most individuals who know SCP-5190 instances have described them as vaguely pleasant but ultimately insubstantial. In 80% of interviews conducted with individuals acquainted with SCP-5190 instances, they have had significant difficulty fully recalling details such as the instance's name and features; in the remaining 20%, they have failed to remember these details altogether.\n\n\nFollowing death, memories of the SCP-5190 instance will rapidly fade from the minds of all individuals who have encountered them. All observed cases have resulted in a complete loss of memories pertaining to the instance after a period of three days, save for a vague notion that the subject in question has forgotten something of little importance.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5190-1:\n Due to lack of Foundation interest, further information on this anomaly is not available.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. Note, however, that the prospect of performing these kinds of actions provokes severe anxiety in most SCP-5190 instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-5189\n | SCP-5190 | \nSCP-5191\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-5190\n\" by Tanhony, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
