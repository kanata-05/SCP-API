Internal security protocols may only be revised / updated by O5 Executive Order, and only after a full Council screening via the \nKnows Test\n.\n\n\nIf an individual undergoes the \nKnows Test\n and SCP-5657 does not give the code-phrase \"I can feel their heart beating\", automated restraints will keep the individual fully immobilized. Should immobilization fail, or the individual poses any eminent threat to SCP-5657's safety, they will be terminated via automatic gunfire. Secondary to SCP-5657's survival, the live capture of a GOI-115 specimen is considered paramount in averting a total SK-Class \"Dominance Shift\" scenario.\n\n\nSCP-5657, together with all knowledge related to its existence, has been permanently restricted to Section-\u00d8N. Upon exiting this area, you will be amnesticized.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5657 is Nikita Ludo, a television personality from Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.A.\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 1997\u00a0Ms. Ludo hosted \nNicki Knows\n, a daytime talk-show formatted to resemble a therapy session. This hour-long program would feature weekly celebrity guests, each recounting childhood experiences and future aspirations in front of Ms. Ludo and a live studio audience. Unlike typical therapy, Ms. Ludo would often criticize and berate her guests to the delight of her audience, revealing any lies or hidden details told throughout the interview with seemingly (and now proven) supernatural accuracy.\n\n\nSCP-5657 is capable of C2M minor empathic communication, i.e. the extrasensory perception of emotions through physical contact. Under ordinary circumstances, SCP-5657 would only require Grade-D passive surveillance. However, SCP-5657 must remain within Section-\u00d8N at all times, having become the target of a newly discovered group of human-mimicking lifeforms \u2014 GOI-115 \u2014 hereafter known as \"Smiling Men\".\n\n\nThe total population, objectives, and anomalous capabilities of the \"Smiling Men\" is currently unknown. However, to date, this group has carried out 26 near-successful assassination attempts on SCP-5657. These breach events continue to occur wherever SCP-5657 is relocated, and against all escalating containment protocols; the most recent attempt being carried out via an undetected form of micro-explosive implanted in the tear-duct of Security Officer Wills. As a direct result, SCP-5657 has been left with 3\nrd\n degree burns on 32% of their epidermis, and partial loss of lower-body mobility.\n\n\nUntil testing is complete, SCP-5657's survival is considered paramount, as currently they are the only known means of detecting \"Smiling Men\".\n\n\nThese entities\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND:\n Stop.

Did you see the first season? Back when it was called \nThe Healing Hour with Dr. Ludo\n? That's how it was supposed to be. That's how the producers pitched it to me.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n So did they\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n And the audience, the cameras \u2014 it didn't really matter; it was all about helping people. That's all I've ever wanted to do, you know. It's why I became a therapist.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Yes, but did the producers\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n I mean\u2014 alright, yes, I liked the attention, and meeting celebrities was a bit of a thrill \u2014 and I obviously have a mild case of histrionic personality disorder, but what else do you expect from the \"weird witch girl\" out of trailer-park-nowhere-Jacksonville finally getting some positive goddam reinforcement for once in her\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Ms. Ludo.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Hm?\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Would you mind answering my question?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Yes, sorry \u2014 what question was that?\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Were the producers aware of your empathic abilities?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Oh. No, they just knew me from reputation.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n As a kind of human therapy dog?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n No, I\u2014 excuse me!?\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Technically speaking, I mean; that is what you did for money before and after dropping out of college, right? You assisted people in finding pleasurable feelings, which you did through physical contact. Would a more apt comparison be to pr\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Wow\u2014 okay\u2014 for starters, I was an \"emotional guide\", thank you very much \u2014 and I didn't drop out! I just took a few years off to work! I really was going to go back and finish my degree, but school was expensive, and over time my side-gig had attracted some wealthy\u2026 patrons. Then they introduced me to Vic and Trism, who pitched me their \nInside the Mind\n show\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n You mean \nThe Healing Hour\n.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n I-\u2026 sorry, what did I say?\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n The truth. We've already spoken to the entire cast and crew, Ms. Ludo. We know the original show was a generic television psychic program, but then you manipulated\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n I didn't\u2014!\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Interview 5657-POI-093, Trism G. Cavalish \u2014 quote, \"I was just humoring her at first, y'know, with her whole 'Healing Hour' thing. Then she reached out and held my hand. Suddenly we were talking about my father, and all the ways I keep trying to live up to his impossible damn expectations\u2026 It took a few hours, but she convinced me.\" End quote. So, you used your abilities to rifle through this man's emotions, made him vulnerable, then coerced him into producing your show. Is that correct?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n That's not\u2014\u2026 that's not even how it works\u2026\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n How does it work, Nicki? For the record.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Well it's \ndifficult\n, since you asked. It's\u2026 imagine touching someone, and suddenly a symphony starts playing \u2014 or death metal \u2014 or free-form jazz. Imagine you look at them, and there's a whole extra dimension of color and size, folding in and spilling of their skin like a melting technicolor silhouette \u2014 and it's doing interpretive dance to that music from before. Imagine, Doctor, trying to figure out what all \nthat\n is supposed to mean, all while your own skin feels like it's on fire, or rotting, or suddenly jolting with overwhelming pleasure. Emotions don't just parade themselves around, telling you exactly what they are like Snow White's goddamn dwarfs! Everyone has a totally different frequency! Some people have shame tangled up in pleasure. Some people mix joy with fear. Some people have anxious, overwhelmed and spiraling out of control as their \nnormal\n \u2014 like they're spinning fifteen barb-wire plates covered in burning tarantulas and that's \nfine\n somehow! And\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Nicki, mechanically speaking, you still just read people's emotions and use that information to influence them, correct?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n: \n(\u2026)\n You're making it sound like some\u2026 parlor trick. I've spent my whole life learning to live with\u2014\u2026 learning how to control my abilities. It took me years to accept they were even \nreal\n. No one else believed me. Growing up I thought\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND:\n Enough. Tell me about the Governor, and what she felt from \nhim\n.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing 5657-IN_09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 5657-09\n\n\nInterviewer: Level 4 Researcher | Dr. Malcolm Adelard\n\n\nInterviewee: SCP-5657 | Nikita Ludo\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n I loved \nThe Healing Hour\n. People didn't. Ratings were low, reviews called it \"softball feel-good garbage\". There was talk of canceling. I mean\u2014\u2026 no one said it out loud, but when I shook the producers' hands\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n They changed their minds after episode 18, correct?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n \n(\u2026)\n Yeah, after the Doherty interview; after my little\u2026 outburst.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Was Ms. Doherty one of the\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n No, no no no. She was human \u2014 by the barest margin. God, I'd never felt such \nloathing\n before. She felt it for everyone, literally everyone \u2014 me, the audience, the crew \u2014 we were all beneath her. She was like a reverse pin-cushion.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Come again?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n It's\u2014\u2026 God, it's so weird being able to just talk about this. So, when a person is more empathetic, their color \u2014 their \naura\n I suppose \u2014 looks a bit like a pin cushion; little tendrils of light reaching out to everyone in the room. That woman though\u2014\u2026 ugh! It wouldn't have been so bad if she was \nhonest\n about it. Instead, she wore this big fake smile and told me she was so \nhappy\n to be on my show \u2014 which was such bullshit. So, yeah! I called her out on it! Loudly, and in front of a live studio audience\u2026 not to mention 3 producers who looked \nextremely\n ready to fire me for rapid-fire-insulting Shannen goddam Doherty.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n But instead, they gave you a second season.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n They gave me a whole new \nshow\n is what they did! How could they not when the ratings exploded like that? Everyone was talking about it! I was on the cover of \nTV Guide\n, \nPeople\n magazine, even\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n I thought it was all about helping people, Nicki.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n That\u2014\u2026 I was just saying that\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n \nNicki Knows\n was more popular though, wasn't it? All you had to do was help them find some confidence, ease their anxieties, make them feel safe \u2014 and suddenly your celebrity guests are sharing all their deepest, darkest secrets for everyone to laugh at. Now that's a much better show \u2014 or, at least, a better circus\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n You don't need to do that, you know.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n \n(\u2026)\n Pardon me?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n You keep provoking me so I'll argue. I get it. People don't like spilling their guts, but they love correcting people they're angry at. It's an old tactic, but it works. Despite what you people \nfeel\n about me, I'm not just my ability. I know how this works. I made a \nliving\n off this.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Ms. Ludo\u2014\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n You're supposed to apologize afterwards, by the way. Reconcile. Build a rapport. Then, all those heightened emotions will become associated with intimacy instead of animosity, and your interviewee opens right up\u2026 though, I guess this isn't a talk show interview, or a therapy session, is it? You're just collecting data from an asset.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Data we need to protect you, and the rest of the world, Ms. Ludo.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Which I get. Look, I can't say much for the accommodations, but I'd much rather be on this side of the blast-doors than out there with\u2026 \nthem\n. I'm on your side. You want to know something? Quit pulling my strings like a baby with a banjo and just \ntalk to me\n.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n \n(\u2026)\n So, season 2.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Yeah, Season 2. Like you said, I'd invite on a celebrity guest, hold their hand, listen to them lie for 10 minutes, then spend another 10 tearing them completely apart; and yeah, the audience loved it. Tears. Laughter. Screaming. Our security guys worked harder than Jerry Springer's, not to mention the censors. We made it 28 glorious episodes until\u2014\u2026 until \nit\n walked on stage\u2014\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n It? You mean Governor Ma\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n That \nthing\n. Yes.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND:\n No. Show me.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing 5657-NN02_28_ENG_24SD.MP4\u00a0TC 01:21:16:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n5657-NN02_28_ENG_24SD.MP4\n\n\nVideo Source:\n Broadcast television recording.\n\n\n\n\nSound of applause. Fade in from black. Camera 3 moves in a semi-circle around the live audience.\n Nicki Knows \nlogo fades in over a ripple effect at center screen.\n\n\nCamera 1 slow pans in on a central, elevated podium surrounded by the audience. Nicki Ludo sits in a red leather armchair across from an empty therapy couch. She makes a few pen scribbles on a paper pad, then looks up at the camera.\n\n\nNicki:\n Hello, and welcome back. We were just speaking to film star Mel Gibson about his childhood, and his feelings towards Jesus. For those of you that missed it, it turns out he has some very\u2026 intense feelings about the \nBody\n of Christ.\n\n\nAudience laughs.\n\n\nNicki:\n But now I'm pleased to introduce our second guest. He's been called the Favorite Son of Maryland \u2014 and who knows \u2014 you might see him on the 2000 Presidential Ballot! Please, everyone welcome Governor Timothy Marshall!\n\n\nAudience applauds. Governor Marshall, 181cm, black hair, pale complexion walks down the audience aisle, waving and shaking hands along the way. Governor Marshall steps on the stage, smiles broadly, and grasps Nicki's hand.\n\n\nOver the course of 2 seconds, Nicki's face turns from a cheerful smile to abject horror. Nicki then shrieks and jumps back.\n\n\nNicki and Governor Marshall stare at each other \u2014 Marshall perplexed, Nicki terrified. Audience watches in silence.\n\n\nNicki runs off stage.\n\n\nFootage cuts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND:\n What was it though?

I've held hands with psychopaths and sociopaths. I've met people who are so repressed that it's like seeing a flickering light at the bottom of a deep well. This wasn't that. I'm saying, Doctor, that there was no well. No light. No shape, or smell, or feeling of \nanything\n. He was \nempty\n.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n I can see how that'd be\u2026 unsettling, but your reaction seemed rather extreme\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Okay, I'm not explaining this properly. It\u2026 it wasn't just an absence of feeling, Doc, it was like an empty space where a person should be. It was like a Governor-shaped cut-out in the skin of the world; a living, breathing, totally unfeeling \nnothing\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND:\n Fascinating.

I didn't just run off-stage; I ran clear out of the country! I don't think I'll ever be able to properly explain how\u2026 wrong it had felt. I didn't even tell anyone where I was going \u2014 I was that scared. I barely stopped to grab my bag and coat from the dressing room, then it was just me and my Porsche hauling ass to Mexico.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Why Mexico?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n It was closer than Canada? I don't know Doc, I wasn't acting rationally. I just felt like I had to \nrun\n. Along the way though \u2014 God, I was so paranoid then \u2014 but everywhere I went these black cars kept following me through every turn. One night they even tried to box me in, run me off the road! I kept speeding up, taking sudden exits, heading further East when I wanted to go South. I didn't stop for 72 straight hours; not until I hit Texas, and the border. Once I was finally across I pulled into this little motel and\u2026 well, you know what happened then.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND: I don't, actually.

Zeta-12 open fire.\n\n\nMultiple shots connect with the torso, neck, and legs. Hostile is undeterred. Camera feed is briefly interrupted as 12-2, 12-3, and 12-4 are knocked to the floor. Screaming, and loud wet cracking sounds are heard.\n\n\n12-3 rolls over. Hostile is seen pinning 12-1 to the ground, and ferociously smashing their head into 12-1\u2019s own, repeatedly. Both the subject and 12-1's skulls are terminally fractured within seconds. 12-1 flatlines. Hostile is still fully mobile despite large sections of brain matter being exposed.\n\n\nHostile runs out of the motel room. The remaining members of Zeta-12 re-group, take up position, and over 12 seconds of sustained gunfire obliterate 36% of the figure's body.\n\n\nHostile stumbles several steps from the highway, then collapses. The body is seen convulsing for several seconds, then dissolves, leaving only a set of clothing and a gas-slick-like puddle evaporating on the asphalt.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSER_NOT_FOUND:\n Such a waste.

So, I went to get a quick vending machine lunch. 20 seconds, tops. When I got back with my Cheetos he was just\u2026 there. In my room. Standing. Smiling. I didn't even have time to scream before his hands were around my throat. He didn't even squeeze; he just pressed his palms in like a bear trap, crushing my windpipe. Then everything went black.\n\n\n2-second pause.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n I'd felt a lot of things in my life, Doc, but dying\u2026 I didn't know terror and calm could exist together like that. There's no feeling like it.\n\n\n4-second pause.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n But then, out of nowhere he just\u2026 let me go. I was on the floor, gasping, coughing, this god awful ringing building in my ears. I could barely see, but when I looked up at him\u2026 Doc, he was \ncrying\n. Not just crying, but screaming, clawing at his neck, trembling like a scared puppy. I didn't know what was happening at first, but after I got a bit more oxygen to my brain I realized: \nI\n was crying. \nI\n was terrified, and hopeless, and dying\u2026 and without knowing it, I'd somehow forced those feelings onto him.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n That-\u2026 Ms. Ludo, are you saying you can \ntransmit\n your emotions to other people? None of our testing\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n No. Not people. I've\u2026 well, sometimes, I feel like I can almost share a little piece of what I'm feeling with someone I'm\u2014\u2026 really intimate with.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n You mean\u2014\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n I don't mean that, no. I mean emotionally intimate. Someone I'm in sync with, someone I trust\u2026 but no. Like I said before, people are just too different \u2014 too full and complex. Trying to impart my feelings onto someone else would be like\u2026 trying to add a spark to a bonfire. But that \nthing\n had no fire \u2014 no anything. Suddenly I was adding that spark to a dry pine bed. Fwoosh!\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n Incredible. I'm curious, though: why didn't you take your chance to run?\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Because I decided to hit him with a goddamn chair instead. He'd tried to kill me, Doc. I was running on pure instinct. I'd been cornered, exhausted, and terrified. My brain switched from flight to fight. I just screamed and started swinging. I broke his back, his arm, and his nose with that damned chair. He didn't even flinch. He just kept trying to get back up. The only thing that seemed to hurt him was when I grabbed his face and gave him another dose of \nfear.\n\n\n5657 takes a deep breath.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n It worked\u2026 for a while. Maybe I was losing focus, maybe I just wasn't scared enough\u2026 maybe he was getting used to it. I don't know; but he got back on his feet. I had to do something. I grabbed him one last time and gave him the only thing I had left\u2026 anger. That's when he started hitting me. He could have killed me \u2014 easily \u2014 but he didn't. He just hit me, over and over. You've probably seen the medical reports. I'd never even broken a bone before that day, let alone twenty-freaking-seven. It worked, though. I stayed alive long enough for your SWAT guys to show up. You know the rest.\n\n\nDr. Adelard:\n I do, yes. Thank you Nicki. Let's stop here.\n\n\nSCP-5657:\n Oh\u2014 yeah alright. That's\u2026 hey\u2014 hey Doc? Do you think\u2026 are you guys close? I just mean\u2026 you've taken a whole lotta' my blood and bone marrow and\u2014 I don't even know.

Did you see the first season? Back when it was called The Healing Hour with Dr. Ludo ? That's how it was supposed to be. That's how the producers pitched it to me. Dr. Adelard: So did they\u2014 SCP-5657: And the audience, the cameras \u2014 it didn't really matter; it was all about helping people. That's all I've ever wanted to do, you know. It's why I became a therapist. Dr. Adelard: Yes, but did the producers\u2014 SCP-5657: I mean\u2014 alright, yes, I liked the attention, and meeting celebrities was a bit of a thrill \u2014 and I obviously have a mild case of histrionic personality disorder, but what else do you expect from the \"weird witch girl\" out of trailer-park-nowhere-Jacksonville finally getting some positive goddam reinforcement for once in her\u2014 Dr. Adelard: Ms. Ludo. SCP-5657: Hm? Dr. Adelard: Would you mind answering my question? SCP-5657: Yes, sorry \u2014 what question was that? Dr. Adelard: Were the producers aware of your empathic abilities? SCP-5657: Oh. No, they just knew me from reputation. Dr. Adelard: As a kind of human therapy dog? SCP-5657: No, I\u2014 excuse me!? Dr. Adelard: Technically speaking, I mean; that is what you did for money before and after dropping out of college, right? You assisted people in finding pleasurable feelings, which you did through physical contact. Would a more apt comparison be to pr\u2014 SCP-5657: Wow\u2014 okay\u2014 for starters, I was an \"emotional guide\", thank you very much \u2014 and I didn't drop out! I just took a few years off to work! I really was going to go back and finish my degree, but school was expensive, and over time my side-gig had attracted some wealthy\u2026 patrons. Then they introduced me to Vic and Trism, who pitched me their Inside the Mind show\u2014 Dr. Adelard: You mean The Healing Hour . SCP-5657: I-\u2026 sorry, what did I say? Dr. Adelard: The truth. We've already spoken to the entire cast and crew, Ms. Ludo. We know the original show was a generic television psychic program, but then you manipulated\u2014 SCP-5657: I didn't\u2014! Dr. Adelard: Interview 5657-POI-093, Trism G. Cavalish \u2014 quote, \"I was just humoring her at first, y'know, with her whole 'Healing Hour' thing. Then she reached out and held my hand. Suddenly we were talking about my father, and all the ways I keep trying to live up to his impossible damn expectations\u2026 It took a few hours, but she convinced me.\" End quote. So, you used your abilities to rifle through this man's emotions, made him vulnerable, then coerced him into producing your show. Is that correct? SCP-5657: That's not\u2014\u2026 that's not even how it works\u2026 Dr. Adelard: How does it work, Nicki? For the record. SCP-5657: Well it's difficult , since you asked. It's\u2026 imagine touching someone, and suddenly a symphony starts playing \u2014 or death metal \u2014 or free-form jazz. Imagine you look at them, and there's a whole extra dimension of color and size, folding in and spilling of their skin like a melting technicolor silhouette \u2014 and it's doing interpretive dance to that music from before. Imagine, Doctor, trying to figure out what all that is supposed to mean, all while your own skin feels like it's on fire, or rotting, or suddenly jolting with overwhelming pleasure. Emotions don't just parade themselves around, telling you exactly what they are like Snow White's goddamn dwarfs! Everyone has a totally different frequency! Some people have shame tangled up in pleasure. Some people mix joy with fear. Some people have anxious, overwhelmed and spiraling out of control as their normal \u2014 like they're spinning fifteen barb-wire plates covered in burning tarantulas and that's fine somehow! And\u2014 Dr. Adelard: Nicki, mechanically speaking, you still just read people's emotions and use that information to influence them, correct? SCP-5657: : (\u2026) You're making it sound like some\u2026 parlor trick. I've spent my whole life learning to live with\u2014\u2026 learning how to control my abilities.

Ratings were low, reviews called it \"softball feel-good garbage\". There was talk of canceling. I mean\u2014\u2026 no one said it out loud, but when I shook the producers' hands\u2014 Dr. Adelard: They changed their minds after episode 18, correct? SCP-5657: (\u2026) Yeah, after the Doherty interview; after my little\u2026 outburst. Dr. Adelard: Was Ms. Doherty one of the\u2014 SCP-5657: No, no no no. She was human \u2014 by the barest margin. God, I'd never felt such loathing before. She felt it for everyone, literally everyone \u2014 me, the audience, the crew \u2014 we were all beneath her. She was like a reverse pin-cushion. Dr. Adelard: Come again? SCP-5657: It's\u2014\u2026 God, it's so weird being able to just talk about this. So, when a person is more empathetic, their color \u2014 their aura I suppose \u2014 looks a bit like a pin cushion; little tendrils of light reaching out to everyone in the room. That woman though\u2014\u2026 ugh! It wouldn't have been so bad if she was honest about it. Instead, she wore this big fake smile and told me she was so happy to be on my show \u2014 which was such bullshit. So, yeah! I called her out on it! Loudly, and in front of a live studio audience\u2026 not to mention 3 producers who looked extremely ready to fire me for rapid-fire-insulting Shannen goddam Doherty. Dr. Adelard: But instead, they gave you a second season. SCP-5657: They gave me a whole new show is what they did! How could they not when the ratings exploded like that? Everyone was talking about it! I was on the cover of TV Guide , People magazine, even\u2014 Dr. Adelard: I thought it was all about helping people, Nicki. SCP-5657: That\u2014\u2026 I was just saying that\u2014 Dr. Adelard: Nicki Knows was more popular though, wasn't it? All you had to do was help them find some confidence, ease their anxieties, make them feel safe \u2014 and suddenly your celebrity guests are sharing all their deepest, darkest secrets for everyone to laugh at. Now that's a much better show \u2014 or, at least, a better circus\u2014 SCP-5657: You don't need to do that, you know. Dr. Adelard: (\u2026) Pardon me? SCP-5657: You keep provoking me so I'll argue. I get it. People don't like spilling their guts, but they love correcting people they're angry at. It's an old tactic, but it works. Despite what you people feel about me, I'm not just my ability. I know how this works. I made a living off this. Dr. Adelard: Ms. Ludo\u2014 SCP-5657: You're supposed to apologize afterwards, by the way. Reconcile. Build a rapport. Then, all those heightened emotions will become associated with intimacy instead of animosity, and your interviewee opens right up\u2026 though, I guess this isn't a talk show interview, or a therapy session, is it? You're just collecting data from an asset. Dr. Adelard: Data we need to protect you, and the rest of the world, Ms. Ludo. SCP-5657: Which I get. Look, I can't say much for the accommodations, but I'd much rather be on this side of the blast-doors than out there with\u2026 them . I'm on your side. You want to know something? Quit pulling my strings like a baby with a banjo and just talk to me . Dr. Adelard: (\u2026) So, season 2. SCP-5657: Yeah, Season 2. Like you said, I'd invite on a celebrity guest, hold their hand, listen to them lie for 10 minutes, then spend another 10 tearing them completely apart; and yeah, the audience loved it. Tears.

        "Recovery Log \u2014 SCP-5657 Location: Hotel Correo, Ju\u00e1rez, Chih., Mexico. Mobile Task Force: MTF-Zeta-12 \"Black Baggers\" Zeta-12-1 knocks on the door of Motel Room 12. Zeta-12-1|Helmen : Ms. Ludo, this is the Mexican Federal Police. Please open the door. 2 seconds silence. Zeta-12-1|Helmen : Ma\u2019am, this is the MFP. We need you to\u2014 Zeta-12-4|Roth : Wait, did you hear that? Quiet a second\u2026 12-4 leans in. A faint clattering is heard, followed by a muffled scream and the sound of shattering glass. Zeta-12 immediately draw their sidearms and breach the motel room. Zeta-12-1|Helmen : Police! Hands up! Hands up right now! Sir, put your hands up! Let go of the woman! A tall white male is seen on the far end of the room, pressing Ms. Ludo against the eastern wall, hands around her throat. Nicki thrashes, while the male figure is perfectly still. As Zeta-12 enters, he drops Ms. Ludo and turns around. Both he and Ms. Ludo are covered in blood and evidence of extreme trauma. Unknown Male: Oh thank Christ! Guys, listen, this isn't what it looks like; she attacked me ! This crazy bitch invited me back here to her room to\u2014 y'know \u2014 to fool around, and then all of a sudden she\u2014 Nickita Ludo : He\u2019s lying! He\u2019s not even human! He\u2019s empty! THEY'RE ALL EMPTY! Unknown Male: See? She's totally whacked out. Probably on drugs or something. Listen, I think I need to get to a hospital, I\u2014 Zeta-12-2|Fields: Yeah, you do. Unknown Male: I\u2014\u2026 what? Zeta-12-2|Fields: Your arm. The male figure looks sideways. The radial bone of his left arm is fractured open. Pieces of the bone are seen extending out from a large gash. Subject shows no signs of discomfort, even as he rotates his arm up well past baseline human flexibility. The sound of tendon and bones snapping is heard. Subject inspects the radial bone now inches from his face. Unknown Male: (monotone) Ah. Zeta-12-1|Helmen: Don\u2019t. Move. Subject continues to stare at his arm, then drops it in a careless, rag-doll-like manner. His face shows a placid smile as he begins to approach Zeta-12. Zeta-12-1|Helmen: I said don\u2019t move! The male figure lunges forward. Zeta-12 open fire. Multiple shots connect with the torso, neck, and legs. Hostile is undeterred. Camera feed is briefly interrupted as 12-2, 12-3, and 12-4 are knocked to the floor. Screaming, and loud wet cracking sounds are heard. 12-3 rolls over. Hostile is seen pinning 12-1 to the ground, and ferociously smashing their head into 12-1\u2019s own, repeatedly. Both the subject and 12-1's skulls are terminally fractured within seconds. 12-1 flatlines. Hostile is still fully mobile despite large sections of brain matter being exposed. Hostile runs out of the motel room. The remaining members of Zeta-12 re-group, take up position, and over 12 seconds of sustained gunfire obliterate 36% of the figure's body. Hostile stumbles several steps from the highway, then collapses. The body is seen convulsing for several seconds, then dissolves, leaving only a set of clothing and a gas-slick-like puddle evaporating on the asphalt.",

        "USER_NOT_FOUND: Now, how did she survive so long?",
        "Dr. Adelard: I'm sorry, did you say ten minutes? You fought that thing for ten minutes ? How in God's name did you\u2014 SCP-5657: I made it cry. Dr. Adelard: You\u2026 excuse me? SCP-5657: You heard me. Now stop interrupting me and let me tell my damn story. We both know I'll never publish an autobiography and\u2026 well, chances are, you all might be my last audience. Dr. Adelard: (\u2026) Please continue, Ms. Ludo. SCP-5657: (sighs) So, I paid for my motel room in cash, and I was standing over the bed so damn ready to pass out\u2026 but then my stomach reminded me it'd also been 72 hours since I ate . So, I went to get a quick vending machine lunch. 20 seconds, tops. When I got back with my Cheetos he was just\u2026 there. In my room. Standing. Smiling. I didn't even have time to scream before his hands were around my throat. He didn't even squeeze; he just pressed his palms in like a bear trap, crushing my windpipe. Then everything went black. 2-second pause. SCP-5657: I'd felt a lot of things in my life, Doc, but dying\u2026 I didn't know terror and calm could exist together like that. There's no feeling like it. 4-second pause. SCP-5657: But then, out of nowhere he just\u2026 let me go. I was on the floor, gasping, coughing, this god awful ringing building in my ears. I could barely see, but when I looked up at him\u2026 Doc, he was crying . Not just crying, but screaming, clawing at his neck, trembling like a scared puppy. I didn't know what was happening at first, but after I got a bit more oxygen to my brain I realized: I was crying. I was terrified, and hopeless, and dying\u2026 and without knowing it, I'd somehow forced those feelings onto him. Dr. Adelard: That-\u2026 Ms. Ludo, are you saying you can transmit your emotions to other people? None of our testing\u2014 SCP-5657: No. Not people. I've\u2026 well, sometimes, I feel like I can almost share a little piece of what I'm feeling with someone I'm\u2014\u2026 really intimate with. Dr. Adelard: You mean\u2014 SCP-5657: I don't mean that, no. I mean emotionally intimate. Someone I'm in sync with, someone I trust\u2026 but no. Like I said before, people are just too different \u2014 too full and complex. Trying to impart my feelings onto someone else would be like\u2026 trying to add a spark to a bonfire. But that thing had no fire \u2014 no anything. Suddenly I was adding that spark to a dry pine bed. Fwoosh! Dr. Adelard: Incredible. I'm curious, though: why didn't you take your chance to run? SCP-5657: Because I decided to hit him with a goddamn chair instead. He'd tried to kill me, Doc. I was running on pure instinct. I'd been cornered, exhausted, and terrified. My brain switched from flight to fight. I just screamed and started swinging. I broke his back, his arm, and his nose with that damned chair. He didn't even flinch. He just kept trying to get back up. The only thing that seemed to hurt him was when I grabbed his face and gave him another dose of fear. 5657 takes a deep breath. SCP-5657: It worked\u2026 for a while. Maybe I was losing focus, maybe I just wasn't scared enough\u2026 maybe he was getting used to it. I don't know; but he got back on his feet. I had to do something. I grabbed him one last time and gave him the only thing I had left\u2026 anger. That's when he started hitting me. He could have killed me \u2014 easily \u2014 but he didn't. He just hit me, over and over. You've probably seen the medical reports. I'd never even broken a bone before that day, let alone twenty-freaking-seven. It worked, though. I stayed alive long enough for your SWAT guys to show up. You know the rest. Dr. Adelard: I do, yes. Thank you Nicki. Let's stop here. SCP-5657: Oh\u2014 yeah alright. That's\u2026 hey\u2014 hey Doc? Do you think\u2026 are you guys close? I just mean\u2026 you've taken a whole lotta' my blood and bone marrow and\u2014 I don't even know. Have you found a way to\u2014? Dr. Adelard: Don't worry, Ms. Ludo. I think we're very close to a breakthrough. You'll be out of here in no time. SCP-5657: (\u2026) Shake on it? End Log.",

What are you\u2026 USER_NOT_FOUND: We always thought a smile was just a curve of the lips. We thought that's all there was to it. We played all your little social games, said all the right words, and we smiled. So simple. So easy. But then we met you. SCP-5657: H-how\u2014!? How are you even here!? We're under a goddam mountain! USER_NOT_FOUND: Oh, the same reason as always, Nicki. The human element. Our mutual friend Dr. Adelard knew there was no making another Nicki; not after decades of tests, decades of protecting you at cost. Then we took someone he was close to. Wills, I believe his name was. So we cut a deal. Armistice, for you. SCP-5657: Oh gh\u2014\u2026 oh god\u2026 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588! Just\u2014!

        "Feedsource: SCP-5657 Containment Cell. USER_NOT_FOUND reaches out to seize Nicki Ludo. Their hand passes cleanly through the space where Nicki's neck should be. USER_NOT_FOUND stands motionless for several seconds, rotating their hand with a puzzled expression. They look back up at Nicki. Nicki vanishes. The containment door directly behind USER_NOT_FOUND seals back shut. Nicki re-appears in an armchair on the opposite side of the room. Nicki: Care to sit? USER_NOT_FOUND: What\u2014\u2026 What is this? Nicki: Holographics. Pretty cool, right? Technology has come crazy far since I was broadcasting to CRTs\u2026 or, sorry, did you mean generally? Well then, this is a trap. USER_NOT_FOUND spins on heel, staring at all four corners of the room. Their expression is deadpan, but their body language shows visible signs of panic. USER_NOT_FOUND: No. No, you touched my wrist. This is your cell. You were here . Nicki: Keyword being \"were\". You're right though, this was my cell. I hadn't left it in 20 years \u2014 not until tonight. USER_NOT_FOUND: (\u2026) You planned this. Nicki: No \u2588\u2588\u2588, Smiley. They moved me out the secret side-door nearly 20 minutes ago; right after I gave you an extra big dose of curiosity . Honestly, we only needed you idle for, like, 15 seconds \u2014 but you kept flipping through files. I outdid myself! USER_NOT_FOUND: This can't\u2014\u2026 Adelard\u2014 Nicki: Played you. I played you. Even the AI played you. Ain't that right, EVAS ?",
        "Nicki: Nonsense. You clearly missed your calling as an actor, EVAS . But, I guess you'll have to settle for being this thing's warden. USER_NOT_FOUND begins pacing, frantically, before reaching up for their own throat. Nicki: Hey, now, none of that. See those panels on the wall? Tell 'im what's behind them, Doc. Intercom | Dr. Adelard: Congelation cannons. High-pressure foam spray that hardens to 3000 kilograms per cubic meter in .002 seconds from contact. Nicki: What he said. Instant statue. USER_NOT_FOUND slowly lowers their hand. Nicki: Atta' whatever-you-are. Now, I'd suggest you get comfortable. These guys run a lot of tests. USER_NOT_FOUND: I don't understand. Nicki: Sorry, Isn't it obvious? This cell was designed to keep things like you out . It'll do just as good a job keeping you in . The holographic projection of Nicki Ludo stands, with difficulty. The damaged portions of her left leg are supplemented by a robotic knee-brace. She brushes herself off, and walks directly up to USER_NOT_FOUND, looking them in the eye. Nicki: Settle in, \u2588\u2588hole. You're SCP-5657 now. Nicki disappears, directly after giving a bright, cheerful smile."
