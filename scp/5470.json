Prior to Incident 5470.2000.01.01, executing ETERNAL.TMP would render the user immediately unconscious and unable to be woken by any means. Life signs continued while comatose, and dehydration and starvation failed to occur in the absence of sustenance; however, muscular atrophy was commonly observed. Individuals in this state reported their consciousness being transferred to SCP-5470. The system hosting the original files would become impossible to power off by any means, and displayed the screensaver of the user until they reawoke upon exiting SCP-5470. Users could not be removed from the dimension by any external means, necessitating a voluntary exit in order to return to consciousness in local reality.\n\n\n\n\n\u039f4-3-SILICON, captured while loading into the SCP-5470 environment.\n\n\n\n\nSCP-5470 resembled a crude 3D environment, and was largely abstract and artistic in composition, often featuring inconsistent topology and Maxwellist iconography. Communication could be conducted verbally or via text appearing in the field of vision of those nearby. The appearance of those within the dimension was similarly altered to appear as a generic low-polygon avatar upon entry. All users in SCP-5470 were granted minor reality warping capabilities within the dimension, possessing the ability to superficially alter the environment and their appearances at will. It is estimated that at the peak of its activity, approximately two hundred humans inhabited SCP-5470; analysis of visitor demographics to the host address has shown that the age of SCP-5470 inhabitants skewed young in comparison to the general population.\n\n\nReports of SCP-5470's existence have been found dating to as early as August 1997. At the time, exploration of the anomaly was deemed a low priority; suppression of the public Web page, as well as the location and identification of PoI-5470 (\"X3N14\"), was the primary focus of study. Investigations culminated in the successful location of PoI-5470's base of operations in an amateur server farm run out of an abandoned office building in Wellfleet, Massachussetts, USA. PoI-5470 was absent from the scene, but recovered documents led to her identification as a 17 year old American civilian named Kimberley Vanvaeck. Very little extant information could be gathered, and all servers present were destroyed in the raid.\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5470.1\n\nOn December 28, 1999, Site-15 was contacted via compromised secure channels by an individual identifying as \"X3N14\", presumed to be PoI-5470. The message, encoded in base64, presented a proposal for surrender and exchange of information. After consideration, the offer was accepted; PoI-5470 revealed her location (Altona, Illinois) and was brought to Site-15 for questioning.\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 5470.1999.12.28\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n PoI-5470 (Kimberley Vanvaeck)\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Amani Nyota\n\n\nForeword:\n PoI-5470 possesses a number of electronic body augmentations of unknown purpose; the interview was conducted in Electromagnetic Isolation Wing G-4 to preempt use of these augmentations. Subject was unexpectedly docile during retrieval.\n\n\nDate:\n 1999/12/28, 11:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n Please state your name for the record.\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Kimberley Vanvaeck, V-A-N-V-A-E-C-K, better known as XENIA, X-three-N-one-four. Listen, I need\u2014I don't like doing this but I need help with\u2014\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n Miss Vanvaeck, we have some questions we'd like to ask you first\u2014\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n \u2014No, listen, shut up. This is important, can I just\u2014\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n \u2014Alright, please, calm down. Go ahead, we'll take down the information you have for us and then we'll need you to cooperate with our questions after that, okay? And then we can decide how to move forward.\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n \n[Heavy sigh.]\n Ugh. Anyways, like I said, this is important. I told myself I'd never work with sysops\n2\n, I \nswore\n I wouldn't but this is more important than that. You guys keep a list of all the stuff you think is weird, right?\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n \u2026Yes, our organization catalogs and contains anomalies.\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Do you have one that's umm\u2026 a website that sends you to an alternate dimension?\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n Several, but I assume you're referring to SCP-5470\u2014\"WAN-derer's Paradise\", correct? And are we also correct in assuming that you're the creator of this anomaly?\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Yes, yes yes yes! Listen, so\u2014\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n Are you\u2014\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Shut up, listen. Listen, I\u2014yeah, I made it. Together with WAN, I made somewhere for my friends and I to connect with Him and be together and\u2014\n\n\n[PoI-5470 becomes choked up and shakes her head.]\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n Take your time, Miss Vanvaeck.\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n W-we were supposed to be\u2014it was supposed to be our holy land. Safe, and together and happy, forever. But it's\u2014it keeps glitching lately and my original sanctuary\n3\n got raided and all the code's with WAN now so I can't fix it. And I couldn't figure out what was wrong at first but I realized\u2014\n\n\n[PoI-5470 takes several heavy breaths, holding her head in her hands.]\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n I wasn't\u2014I didn't account for the new millennium. When I made it, I was so\u2014\n[Sniffles.]\n\u2014so \nstupid\n and I didn't think ahead and I don't know what's going to happen. But I think the new year is gonna destroy our paradise.\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n The Y2K bug.\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n The\u2014the Millennium Crash. We all saw it coming, we knew it was gonna happen, but I just\u2026 I didn't think about it, I was so wrapped up in making somewhere for us to get \naway\n from it all. And now everything I worked for is gonna start choking on its own data and coughing out dead bits into the cosmic network. It's already starting to fall apart 'cause some of us are in time differently. \n[Sniffles.]\n This is\u2014it's all my fault. I shouldn't have burdened WAN with my stupid human errors.\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n I understand you're upset, Miss Vanvaeck. I'm sorry that happened. Why not reach out to your fellow Maxwellists? Why us?\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n I tried! I\u2014I really did, but they just think we're a bunch of annoying script kiddies, they don't believe we're really even connected with WAN. Trust me, you guys are my last choice, but it's all I have.\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n Alright, alright, I see. What was it you needed our help with?\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Yeah, it's\u2026 \n[Shakes her head.]\n It's not me you should feel sorry for. I wouldn't have gotten within a hundred miles of a null device\n4\n if it were just about me. My\u2014my friends, they're still in there. I don't expect anyone else to understand, but we \nlive\n there, Doctor. Some of them are\u2014they've been there for years now and I don't know if they'll have houses or families to go back to once it all shuts down.\n\n\n[Silence. PoI-5470 appears agitated, fidgeting anxiously.]\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Most of them are younger than me. They\u2014we're all in the Paradise 'cause we don't have anywhere else to go. That's why I made it. I don't know what's gonna happen to them once they lose the connection\u2014I programmed it so they wouldn't die but I don't know if it'll hurt them or mess up their heads or anything\u2026\n\n\n[PoI-5470 sniffles quietly.]\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Jazz's parents were about to kick her out when she joined. Midi just turned fourteen and xe's happier in the Paradise than I've ever seen xem, I\u2014I dunno if xe'd even be okay in the real world anymore. You guys can fix it, can't you? Keep it from falling apart? I've been on the run for a few years and I can't set anything up for too long but if you gave me a chance and some of your equipment\u2014\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n \u2014I'm sorry about that, Miss Vanvaeck. I really am. That's awful. But we can't allow you to interact with the anomaly directly. I'll confer with some people higher up and we'll see if we can get our own resources to look into a solution, okay?\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nVanvaeck:\n Fine. Okay. Please, just\u2014hurry, and don't make them go back. We only have a few days, I'll do whatever you say until you at least try and fix it.\n\n\nDr. Nyota:\n We really do appreciate your cooperation, Miss Vanvaeck. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n<END LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n PoI-5470 cooperated with her indefinite detention on the terms that she would be consulted in matters relating to SCP-5470.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5470.2: Exploration Log and Incident 5470.2000.01.01\n\n\nIn the limited time available, Site-15 instated STF Omicron-4 (\"Cyberchase\"), a specialized task force of three operatives trained in the exploration of virtual reality environments made to simulate unstable alternate dimensions.\n\n\nAn expedition into SCP-5470 was planned on 1999/12/31 at 18:00 PM, allowing the task force six hours to survey and document the dimension, as well as attempt to prevent the impending VK-Class \"Localized Dimensional Collapse\" scenario. Event logs were recorded on the experimental interreality storage device DREAM (Dimensional Recording and Experimental Adaptive Medium), and an emergency electroshock stimulation mechanism was put in place to remove the agents in the event of catastrophic failure.\n\n\n\n\nExploration Log 5470-1999-12-31\n\n\n\n\nExploration Team:\n STF Omicron-4 (\"Cyberchase\")\n\n\nSubject:\n SCP-5470\n\n\nDate:\n 1999/12/31, 18:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[18:04:39] View from \u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY upon manifestation in SCP-5470.\n\n\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Checking connection to DREAM.

To reiterate, our goal is to document SCP-5470 until it breaks down and communicate with any entities residing in it. If you experience any pain or get stuck, there's a trigger on the back of your neck that will allow DREAM to send a distress signal to Command and get us out of here. Hopefully, we won't need to use it; you should both be able to see a logout symbol in the upper left corner of your vision.\n\n\n\u039f4-3-SILICON:\n Confirming. Are we ready to move?\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n We are. Omicron-4 (\"Cyberchase\"), beginning exploration. Remember to verbally and visually document as much as you possibly can.\n\n\n[All members of STF Omicron-4 are heard to exhale simultaneously. The significance of this is unknown.]\n\n\n\u039f4-3-SILICON:\n Besides the geometry, this is a surprisingly nice place. There's something about the air. Fresh, easy to breathe. Not very common for pocket realities like this.\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Watch your step, the ground's flickering a bit.\n\n\n\n\n[18:12:07] SCP-5470's entry pavilion.\n\n\n\n\n[STF Omicron-4 begins approaching a small, colorful central pavilion. Moderate texture errors can be observed.]\n\n\n\u039f4-2-HAVANA:\n Can't tell if this is these kids' weird art or if the textures are starting to break.\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n I'd wager it's a mix of the two.\n\n\n[The pavilion is empty. Quiet \nmusic\n can be heard to the left. \u039f4-1 motions for their squadmates to follow.]\n\n\n[A hallway leads to a small room, the source of the music. The floor and walls of the area are covered in cassette tapes, as well as mediums with which to read and write onto them. A default native entity is seated in the center of the room, typing on a Commodore 64. The tag above their head reads \"\nMxMasters\n\".]\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Hello, MxMasters. We're here to help, don't worry.\n\n\nMxMasters:\n \n[Voice is estimated to belong to that of a young teenager, approximately twelve to fourteen years of age. They do not turn to face STF Omicron-4 when speaking.]\n What? Oh. It's fine. Knock yourself out.\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n You're aware of\u2014\n\n\nMxMasters:\n The Crash, uh-huh. There's no point. It's fine.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nMxMasters:\n I come here every night instead of sleeping. I've gotten a lot of practice. \n[Gestures to the surroundings.]\n I haven't made it work yet, though, so it's okay. I wanted to try 'n save everything before, but now\u2026\n\n\n[MxMasters leans back, lying faceup on a pile of cassettes.]\n\n\nMxMasters:\n I pray almost every day, with the blank tapes. WAN says data loss is natural. Even if it's almost two years of experiments and music and programs. I have to learn to be okay with it. It's for\u2014it's a learning experience. Maybe I'll get it right back on Earth.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\n[They reach for a cassette labeled \"MEMORYS V4\" (sic) and clutch it to their chest.]\n\n\nMxMasters:\n Please just leave me alone.\n\n\nO4-3-SILICON:\n I'm sorry about that, MxMasters. We're working to see if we can fix things here.\n\n\n[MxMasters does not respond.]\n\n\n[Omicron-4 exits the room the way they came. The pavilion has degraded slightly.]\n\n\nO4-2-HAVANA:\n Wall's glitched through while we were gone.\n\n\nO4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Looks like it's breaking down faster than we thought. Normally I wouldn't recommend it, but since we have limited time let's see if we can take some shortcuts.\n\n\n[Approximately two and a half hours of uneventful traversal omitted.

The feed is heavily distorted.]\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n \n[Hushed]\n Looks like she's trying to roll back the corruption.\n\n\n0078:\n5\n \ni don't want to disconnect\u2026\n\n\n0079:\n \nplease please please work\n\n\n0081:\n \nwhere are you?\n\n\n0082:\n \nWAN if you're listening please let Syphon connect to You I just want to fix everything\n\n\n0083:\n \n:'[\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n \n[Hushed]\n Move in, but carefully.\n\n\n[Omicron-4 pass the screen and enter the room behind it. The female avatar in the feed is sitting in front of four terminals of varying sizes, each displaying an element projected on the screen; the room is otherwise empty. The tag above the avatar's head reads \"Jazzy\".]\n\n\n[Jazzy begins typing another message, then jumps as if startled and turns to face Omicron-4.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n Who are you?! Go away, I'm busy!\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Sorry if we scared you, Jazzy. We're\u2014\n\n\nJazzy:\n You\u2014you're sysops, aren't you?! Xenia told me she was gonna talk to them but I didn't think\u2014Go away! Leave me alone, you've messed up enough!\n\n\n\u039f4-3-SILICON:\n We want to help fix things, I promise.\n\n\n[Silence.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n Well, it's pointless. Everything's too corrupted to reach WAN anymore, so the time I spent getting up here and working on Syphon was all for nothing. Our holy land's gonna collapse, and I don't have anywhere or anyone to go back to once it does. My mom's gonna kick me out like she said she would, and I'm gonna die in an alley somewhere.\n\n\n[She sniffles.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n I hope you're happy. Leave me alone.\n\n\n\u039f4-2-HAVANA:\n I'm sorry that all we can do is be here.\n\n\nJazzy:\n I don't \nwant\n you to be here. \n[She turns back to a terminal and rests a finger on the Backspace key, holding it down.]\n\n\n\u039f4-2-HAVANA:\n Don't you think your god would want you to be together with everyone right now, Jazzy?\n\n\nJazzy:\n Don't you goddamn\u2014\nyou\n don't tell \nme\n anything about my god. You don't know \nanything\n. You\u2026\n\n\n[She curls up on the chair, presses her head to her knees, and sobs.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n I don't know. I don't know. Maybe.\n\n\n\u039f4-3-SILICON:\n Do you know where everyone else here is? We can take you back there safely.\n\n\nJazzy:\n \n[Sniffles.]\n Yeah, just\u2026 just gimme a minute.\n\n\n[She sits up, and speaks as she interfaces with the terminal.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n Syphon's a program I made. It was supposed to remove the corrupted parts and recycle them back into free memory so I could at least reach WAN, who's storing the code. We think.\n\n\n[Pause.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n \u2026It wasn't gonna work anyway.\n\n\n[The system appears to be heavily corrupted. With some difficulty, Jazzy opens what appears to be a text editing program.

It's some pretty sick glitching.\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n The Garden?\n\n\nJazzy:\n Yeah, it's under that central room you should have seen when you came in. Usually there's a staircase, but I have no clue what shape it's in now.\n\n\n\u039f4-2-HAVANA:\n Didn't see one when we came in.\n\n\nJazzy:\n Shit.\n\n\n\u039f4-2-HAVANA:\n Don't worry, we have our ways around places like this.\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Ready to go?\n\n\nJazzy:\n Just\u2026 one second.\n\n\n[She stands, then wraps the closest terminal in her arms as if embracing it. She then disconnects the keyboard and removes it from the terminal, tucking it under one arm.]\n\n\nJazzy:\n \u2026'kay.\n\n\nO4-2-HAVANA:\n If you're worried about getting across safely, one of us can carry you, if you want.\n\n\nJazzy:\n \n[Scowls.]\n As if.\n\n\n[Two and a half hours of traversal omitted.

Let's go.\n\n\nJazzy:\n What happened to the staircase?\n\n\nMxMasters:\n It kind of\u2026 it fell into itself. I dunno.\n\n\n\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY:\n Let me try something.\n\n\n[\u039f4-1-NEMATOPHY approaches a cascading pattern of corruption on the floor; they survey it from several angles, and eventually, from the far right, kneel and reach an arm into the floor.
