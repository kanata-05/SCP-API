Any otter populations will be observed and contained if necessary.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4508 is a 1.7 meter tall statue depicting a Eurasian otter (\nLutra lutra\n), of unknown geologic composition. No feasible method of damaging SCP-4508 has been discovered. Etched into the base of SCP-4508 is the Arabic word \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u064a\n1\n.\n\n\nSealed within SCP-4508 is a human male identified as Thomas Lapen, designated SCP-4508-1. Despite SCP-4508-1 lacking the ability to consume food or water, MRI scans indicate its vital signs remain stable. The lucidity of SCP-4508-1 is currently unknown.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The Foundation was tipped off by an emergency call originating from Hallsburg, Oregon after the caller claimed that their friend was \"abducted by evil otters\". Field agents found evidence of a struggle in SCP-4508-1's home, and SCP-4508 was discovered in the back yard surrounded by used candles and various species of shellfish.\n\n\nAddendum 4508 -1:\n The following excerpts are from SCP-4508-1's text message records, detailing the chain of events leading to the discovery of SCP-4508.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4/20/2017\n\n\n\n\n6:42pm|Tom:\n Hey man, leaving work now. omw to you.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6:44pm|Rich:\n be safe\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6:49pm|Tom:\n Fuck\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6:50pm|Rich:\n ?\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6:52pm|Tom:\n I hit a weird looking dog or somethign, idfk what it was\u2026 dead now\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6:52pm|Rich:\n Stop fucking around we got shit to do\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6:53pm|Tom:\n k brt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n4/21/2017\n\n\n\n\n8:31am|Rich:\n Did u call me last night?\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9:05am|Tom:\n Was spooked\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9:06am|Rich:\n w h y\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9:07am|Tom:\n Had weirdest fucking dream.
