Research is ongoing to determine the origin of SCP-4134 and contain or neutralise the anomaly, if at all possible.\n\nSCP-4134-1 instances are to be contained in Foundation warehouse located at [DATA REDACTED] by members of ATF Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\") using Procedure 4134-Harpo (see Document 4134-Harpo).\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4134 refers to a pattern of behavior affecting an as-yet-unknown number of mimes within the city of Paris, France.\n\n\nMimes affected by SCP-4134 (designated SCP-4134-1) will travel on foot to areas of high foot traffic within the city. Upon reaching a suitable location, SCP-4134-1 instances will take a kneeling position with both arms extended forward from the shoulder. At this point, SCP-4134-1 instances are considered \"armed\" and will remain completely immobile until triggered. When armed, any force which displaces either hand of SCP-4134-1 more than 3cm will trigger a directional explosion outward from a point in space no more than 30 centimeters in front of the instance's chest, typically resulting in the destruction of both hands.\n\n\nAfter detonation, SCP-4134-1 instances become non-anomalous, typically showing panic and confusion at their injuries. Expiration due to blood loss is common without immediate medical treatment. The Foundation estimates that over \u2588\u2588\u2588 mimes have been killed as a result of SCP-4134, or roughly 14% of the mime population of France, with containment efforts thus far causing an additional 29 Foundation casualties and 61 civilian casualties due to accidental activation of SCP-4134-1 instances.\n\n\nThe Foundation currently has \u2588\u2588 SCP-4134-1 instances in Foundation containment. Research into the origin of SCP-4134 is ongoing (see Interview Log 4134.1), but as of yet the anomaly has not been definitively tied with any GoI, entity, meme, or cognitohazard.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n The first known instance of SCP-4134-1 was discovered following the assassination of Ermst vom Rath outside the German Embassy in Paris on 09/11/1938. Foundation operatives intercepted a telegram sent to \nSonderkommando f\u00fcr Paranormales\n, which described an explosion of unknown source from a mime with \"inconsistent\" blast damage. Data was found to correlate with a previous Extranormal Event which occurred during the capture of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, prompting the designation of SCP-4134.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Interview Log 4134.1\n- Interview Log 4134.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate:\n 12.14.1940\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Richard\n\n\nInterviewee:\n Pablo Laurent, a.k.a. \"Fleur-nez\"\n\n\nPurpose:\n To determine the nature of SCP-4134, as well as identify potential origin of SCP-4134, an interview was conducted with a surviving SCP-4134-1 instance. Mr. Laurent is a mime, typically performing under the name \"Fleur-nez,\" recovered on Rue \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 with major trauma to both hands. Both arms were amputated at the elbow.\n\n\nDr. Richard:\n Good morning, Mr. Laurent. How are you feeling this morning?\n\n\nMr. Laurent shrugs.\n\n\nDr. Richard:\n \n(in English)\n Would you prefer I conduct this interview in English?\n\n\nMr. Laurent shrugs.\n\n\nDr. Richard:\n \n(in English)\n Why won't- oh, of course. \n(Dr. Richard switches to French sign language)\n Good morning, Mr. Laurent. Can you understand me?\n\n\nMr. Laurent nods.\n\n\nR:\n Why were you at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that day?\n\n\nMr. Laurent holds up his arms, which have been amputated at the elbow.\n\n\nR:\n Right.

On the wall is the flag of France.\n\n\nR:\n Can you elaborate on that?\n\n\nMr. Laurent holds up his arms, which have been amputated at the elbow.\n\n\nR:\n Oh, right.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Laurent was held for an additional 48 hours, amnesticized, and released. Review of past medical records shows that Mr. Laurent is a deaf-mute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 11/28/1940, SCP-4134-1 instances have killed over \u2588\u2588 Nazi soldiers, including the high-profile \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and his wife in front of the Eiffel Tower in October 1940. No Allied casualties have been reported. Statistical analysis is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[09.01.1944]\u00a0Revision\u00a004\n\n\n\n\n[09.01.1944]\u00a0Revision\u00a004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n\nThe following is a past revision of the containment documentation for SCP-4134.\n\nThis document has been declassified for historical significance as well as relevance to ongoing SCP-4134 containment efforts, but may not reflect current understanding of the anomaly.\n\n\n\u2014 Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4134\n\n\nObject Class:\n Neutralized\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n As of 08/31/1944, all known SCP-4134-1 instances have ceased anomalous activity. As such, SCP-4134 has been declared Neutralized. Foundation assets assigned to Paris will monitor high-traffic areas for additional SCP-4134 activity. No further containment procedures have been deemed necessary at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4134 was the designation given to a pattern of behavior affecting 21% of mimes in the city of Paris, France. Affected persons (labeled SCP-4134-1) were compelled to travel on foot to high-traffic walkways and kneel with their arms extended forward (considered \"armed\"), becoming completely motionless and immune to all forms of stimuli. Displacing either arm resulted in a directed explosion outward from the chest, typically destroying both of the instance's hands; following this, SCP-4134-1 instances became non-anomalous.\n\n\nDetonation of SCP-4134-1 instances caused between \u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 Nazi casualties in Paris throughout WWII, as well as the deaths of \u2588\u2588 Foundation personnel; over \u2588,\u2588\u2588\u2588 mimes were killed or maimed as a result of SCP-4134-related injuries. Despite the high casualty rate, only \u2588 French civilian deaths have been attributed to SCP-4134. Foundation scientists theorize that this could have been related to the nature of the anomaly, though the mechanism by which SCP-4134 differentiated between targets remains unknown.\n\n\nOn August 25, 1944, all \u2588\u2588\u2588 instances of SCP-4134-1 in Foundation containment spontaneously regained mobility. Testing determined that none of the mimes had retained any anomalous property. All instances were interviewed, but none could provide any explanation of their anomalous properties, nor recall anything during time spent as SCP-4134-1 instances. Following interviews, all instances were administered Class-C amnestics and released.\n\n\nReports confirmed that this reanimation was concurrent to the surrender of German leader Dietrich von Cholitz, marking the liberation of Paris from German forces. Research into SCP-4134 has been suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[02.24.2008]\u00a0Current\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\n[02.24.2008]\u00a0Current\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-4134\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n In the event of a terrorist attack or mass shooting within a 1km radius of Paris, France, Applied Task Force Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\") will conduct a sweep radially from the location of the incident. Upon discovery of any SCP-4134-1 instance, no fewer than three personnel, equipped with blast-resistant gear, are to contain the instance according to Procedure 4134-Harpo until the instance resumes non-anomalous behavior (see Document 4134-Harpo).\n\n\nAll restoration projects performed on Parisian buildings certified as \"historic monuments\" are to be assigned three members of Applied Task Force Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\"), accompanied by two D-class personnel trained in mime, to be converted to instances of SCP-4134-1. Instances are to be contained using Procedure 4134-Harpo on-site until renovations are complete.\n\n\nMembership in ATF Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\") will be granted only to Foundation personnel \nwith French citizenship\n born in France. D-class personnel recruited for use in SCP-4134 containment efforts must also have \nFrench citizenship\n been born in France.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4134 refers to a pattern of behavior exhibited by mimes\n1\n within the city of Paris, France, triggered whenever the city of Paris or any Parisian buildings classified as \"Historic Monuments\" are threatened. Previous threats have included:\n\n\n\n\nMilitary invasion of Paris\n\n\nDestruction of Parisian buildings or monuments certified as \"historic\"\n\n\nRenovation or restoration projects on \"historic\" monuments or buildings, entailing the removal or destruction of major features of same (see Incident Log 4134.3)\n\n\n\n\nWhenever one of the above occurs, one Parisian mime will spontaneously become an instance of SCP-4134-1. Mimes appear to be selected based on proximity to threats, with closer candidates being prioritized over those further away. SCP-4134-1 instances' anomalous properties persist until being \"activated\" (see below), or until the \"threat\" to Paris has been eliminated (for instance, when \"historic\" buildings are returned to normal).\n\n\nUpon conversion, SCP-4134-1 instances travel to a pedestrian walkway within 100 meters of the perceived threat. Upon reaching a suitable location, an instance will take a kneeling position with both arms extended forward from the shoulder. At this point, it is considered \"armed\" and will remain completely immobile until triggered.\n\n\nWhen armed, any force which displaces either hand of SCP-4134-1 more than 3cm will trigger a directional explosion outward from a point in space no more than 30 centimeters in front of the instance's chest, typically resulting in the destruction of both hands.\n\n\nAfter detonation, SCP-4134-1 instances become non-anomalous, typically showing panic and confusion at their injuries. Expiration due to blood loss is common without immediate medical treatment. Individuals are unable to recall time spent as SCP-4134-1 instances, or provide any information about the source of SCP-4134.\n\n\nSCP-4134 was declared Neutralized on 09/01/1944 after all \u2588\u2588\u2588 instances of SCP-4134-1 in Foundation containment lost their anomalous properties. However, three new instances of SCP-4134-1 manifested following the bombing of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in 1960. Testing was conducted to determine the cause of the anomaly. SCP-4134 was subsequently reclassified as Euclid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Incident Report 4134.3\n- Incident Report 4134.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1962\n\nLocation: Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1962, workers began removing the 19th-century grisaille windows in the nave, as part of an extensive restoration effort on the cathedral.

He was in the business of rescuing children, and he wanted me to join him.\n\n\nR:\n This was your cousin, \nGeorges\n?\n\n\nM:\n That's correct. Georges approached me a number of different times to ask me to join different projects, but I was never a fan of combat so I stuck to that kind of job.\n\n\nR:\n Fascinating. May I ask, how did you have time to study mime during this period?\n\n\nM:\n Actually, that's an interesting story. I was in Paris for a month working with the Resistance on some project or other- one of Georges' schemes. I needed to duck into a building quickly to avoid a German officer.

A lot of what the teacher, Mr. Thomas, did was statuary mime, plastic mime. For instance, he would have me stand still for an hour, or try to balance on one hand for as long as I could. I preferred to be in motion, even then, but it gave me time to improve my craft, up until I couldn't stay any longer.\n\n\nR:\n What happened?\n\n\nM:\n One day, this was after I had been there merely a month, I came into the studio and saw Thomas more excited than I'd ever seen. He kept shouting, \"I've done it, I've done it.\" One of his newer students was kneeling on the floor, arms like this. \nMarceau extends his arms forward from the shoulder.\n As soon as he saw me, he jumped up to greet me, but then\u2026\n\n\nMarceau grimaces.\n\n\nR:\n What happened?\n\n\nM:\n I'm not sure. There was an explosion, and suddenly the student was on the floor, screaming, and Mr. Thomas\u2026 half of his leg was gone. I knew that the Germans must have been behind it. Perhaps they meant to reach me, perhaps they learned of my location from my brother. I do not know. All I know is that I left Paris shortly after.\n\n\nR:\n Thank you for coming onto the program today, Mr. Marceau.\n\n\nClosing Message:\n Research into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 School is ongoing.
