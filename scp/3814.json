Former classification: Safe.\n Reclassified to Euclid. See Incident Report 3814/2\n\n\nSCP-3814 is currently contained at the D-Class Cell Block of Site-91. The role of SCP-3814-1 is to be passed between D-Class Personnel indefinitely. Current SCP-3814-1 is forbidden to participate in any tests until they are no longer SCP-3814-1.\n\n\nShould any higher personnel become SCP-3814-1 by any means, they are required to pass the role to a member of the D-Class personnel as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nView\u00a0Original\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nSCP-3814 has been confined to Site-91 and must only be passed onto personnel currently working there. In the event that SCP-3814 should be passed beyond the borders of Site-91 due to evacuation of personnel or other eventualities, it is to be brought back into the facility at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\nStaff member currently designated SCP-3814-1 is required to wear an approved item distinguishing them from other on-site personnel. This item will be passed onto the next SCP-3814-1. No subject is allowed to stay SCP-3814-1 for longer than 24 hours at a time.\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3814 is an anomalous game of Tag. The currently 'tagged' subject, from here on referred to as SCP-3814-1, experiences a mental compulsion to 'tag' any nearby individuals. The strength of this effect increases with time. After approximately 24 hours since tagging, most affected subjects begin to claim that it is almost impossible to resist this compulsion and can attempt to 'tag' others even in inconvenient or even dangerous situations. (See Incident Report 3814/1).\n\n\nIn addition to this, SCP-3814-1 will not experience any such compulsive tendencies towards the previously 'tagged' person. After SCP-3814 has been passed onto another person, all effects it had on SCP-3814-1 will cease. \nNo other effects have been observed.\n (See Incident Report 3814/2)\n\n\nOnce the subject becomes SCP-3814-1, the rules of SCP-3814 are permanently embedded in their memories through anomalous means.\n\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the rules as written down by one of the subjects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo tag you have to touch the person and say \"Tag, you're it!\"\n\n\nYou cannot tag the person who tagged you.\n\n\nThe tag MUST be passed on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll investigative attempts to uncover the origin of SCP-3814 have failed. SCP-3814 was brought into Site-91 in 2005 by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was unaware of its anomalous nature at the time. Later it was found that SCP-3814 was passed onto Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 by a family member, who was 'tagged' by their co-worker\u2026 While this backtracking of SCP-3814's history was not able to identify an origin of the anomaly, it has proven that it existed as far back as 18\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Incident Report 3814/1\n\nOn 06/11/2009, SCP-3814-1 (at the time, Dr. Lisa Arlington) was killed during an experiment with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n1\n\n\nThe remnants of Dr. Arlington's body were taken care of according to standard Foundation procedure in such manners. SCP-3814 reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n\nAddendum:\n Incident Report 3814/2\n\nOn 07/11/2009, approximately 24 hours after her death, Dr. Arlington was sighted at Site-91, lying unconscious in a hallway leading to staff dormitories. Dr. Erwick called site security to aid him in relocating Dr. Arlington to on-site infirmary. Medical evaluation didn't find any abnormalities in Dr. Arlington's physiology. Following is an interview conducted by Dr. Erwick shortly after Dr. Arlington regained consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Dr. Arlington\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Dr. Erwick\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n What happened to you, Lisa?\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n I don't know.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Do you remember anything after your- After the incident with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588?\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n No. I remember waking up here at the medical bay.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Lisa, please. Try harder. You must remember something.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n I am sorry, Chris - I just don't recall anything.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Okay. Fine\u2026 Alright. I apologise, it must be hard.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n What must be hard? Everyone is acting weird around me, what is it?\n\n\nDr. Erwick is silent\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n Chris, tell me.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n We thought you were dead.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n Well, I clearly survived.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n No. You didn't.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n What?\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n You died, Lisa. We have no clue why you appeared this morning\u2026\n\n\nNeither participant speaks for almost twenty seconds.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n I know. I couldn't believe it either, Lisa. Whatever happened is a miracle.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n Chris\u2026\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n I don't know what I would do without you\u2026\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n Chris!\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Yes?\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n [Dr. Arlington appears to be in pain.] I think I remember something.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Yes, of course. And what is it?\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n It's- it's just a bunch of words, sentences maybe. I can't make anything of it though.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Words? Can you tell me about any of these words?\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n It's like some rules. In my mind. Gosh it hurts.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n We can stop if you-\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n The tag must be passed on.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Do you mean the Site-91 Tag? SCP-3814?\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n \nThe tag must be passed on\n.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Lisa, you already said that.\n\n\nDr. Arlington stays silent for another 11 seconds, then repeats herself once more.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Lisa?\n\n\nNo reaction from Dr. Arlington.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Lisa? [Dr. Erwick is about to leave the room.]\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n Wait. Chris.\n\n\nDr. Erwick returns to Dr. Arlington.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n Hold my hand, please.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n [Dr. Erwick makes physical contact with Dr. Arlington.] I am here for you, Lisa.\n\n\nDr. Arlington:\n \u2026Tag\u2026 .You're it.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n [Dr. Erwick seems confused.] What?\n\n\nDr. Arlington suddenly expires without any visible explanation.\n\n\nDr. Erwick:\n Lisa? Lisa! No! Please! No- [EXPLETIVE REDACTED]\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nClosing Statement:\n Dr. Erwick was removed out of the room and later questioned. It would appear that SCP-3814 grants temporal reanimation in cases where SCP-3814-1 dies before they can tag someone else. Further research denied. SCP-3814 reclassified to Euclid. Containment Procedures updated according to Dr. Erwick's suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n. It appears that Dr. Arlington has overestimated her ability to resist the compulsive effect of SCP-3814 and attempted to 'tag' a D-Class personnel during the test resulting in her death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3813\n | SCP-3814 | \nSCP-3815\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3814\n\" by Utylike, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
