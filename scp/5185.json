SCP-5185 instances are to be contained in a dog day care center within Site-37 with a chain link fence separating them from research personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5185 are an unclassified subspecies of giant house spider \n(Eratigena atrica).\n Each possesses the physical, psychological, and social needs of an average domesticated canine. When first brought into Foundation care, each SCP-5185 instance was approximately the size of a six to ten week-old puppy, with their internal biology modified to allow them to survive at this size. Each instance has since grown to the size of a border collie \n(45.72\u00a0cm - 55.88\u00a0cm tall).\n SCP-5185 instances also have a base level of intelligence congruent with that of an average border collie.\n\n\nSCP-5185 instances have been observed showing aggressive behaviour towards staff, charging at researchers while making high pitched noises similar to growling, biting the chain link fence, and lunging.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-5185 were purchased from a renovated Coca-Cola branded vending machine on the sidewalk of 6th Street, Macaque, Il. The dispenser, designated SCP-5185-A, had five compartments made from plexiglas with a fleece blanket at the bottom of every compartment. Each contained one instance of SCP-5185. Despite what is advertised on the flyer, no purchase from SCP-5185-A has produced anything matching the description of a \"fine dog.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlyer for SCP-5185. Other flyers have been found reading \u201cplease adopt spider\u201d and \u201cfree spider. just take.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5185-1:\n\n\nVideo log from SCP-5185\u2019s containment unit. Each instance is designated a number, 1-7.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n\n7:13 AM:\n SCP-5185-1 wakes up after being kicked in the abdomen by SCP-5185-4. It turns to a different sleeping position before resting its head\n\n\n7:24 AM:\n SCP-5185-6 sits up and drinks water from its water bowl. It walks over to the play set and picks up a chew toy.\n\n\n7:26 AM:\n SCP-5185-1 looks around before bounding over to SCP-5185-6. It picks up one of its legs and bats SCP-5185-6. It looks inquisitively at SCP-5185-1, dropping the chew toy. SCP-5185-1 picks up a rope toy, shaking it around in its jaws.\n\n\n7:28 AM:\n SCP-5185-6 grabs the rope toy, starting a tug-of-war match with SCP-5185-1.\n\n\n7:30 AM:\n SCP-5185-1 loses.

A play fight ensues.\n\n\n7:33 AM:\n SCP-5185-4 hops up and joins the fight.\n\n\n7:34 AM:\n The three instances join into a dog pile while continuing to play fight.\n\n\n7:36 AM:\n The three instances get tired of play fighting, deciding to climb on the play set instead. Other instances soon awaken and join.\n\n\n7:40 AM:\n Instances of SCP-5185 notice bowls of food and run over to eat.\n\n\n8:01 AM:\n Instances are separated for personal training.\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5185-2:\n\n\nSeveral undercover Foundation employees contacted the \u201c\nfinedadoinstagram\n\u201d account about the lack of dogs being dispensed from SCP-5185-A.
