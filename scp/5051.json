Internally, SCP-5051 possesses no abnormalities except for a former broom closet lined with containment-grade alloy blast shielding.\n\n\nSCP-5051 appears on no Foundation lists, and no record exists of its construction or former staff. No identifying material remains, except for the words \"SCP-5051\" written on a sticky note on a door, and a broken Foundation ID reader at the door to the broom closet.\n\n\nEntering the broom closet causes inconsistent memory loss, the instantaneous formation of burns on the head, and confusion. The broom closet is otherwise found to be empty.\n\n\nOpening a damaged wall revealed a personal storage vault, which contained a personal Foundation-issue tablet.\n\n\nThe tablet appeared to contain no data; however, personnel affected by SCP-5051 claimed to see several files existing on the tablet, which they transcribed to the best of their ability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTER\u00a0CREDENTIALS\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5051\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n SCP-5051 is contained in an isolated chamber in the lowest floor of Provisional Site-273.\n\n\nFurther data regarding SCP-5051's containment is restricted to operative personnel directly in contact with SCP-5051. The identities of these personnel have been removed from the main Foundation database.\n\n\nSapient personnel are not to come in contact with SCP-5051, nor become aware of SCP-5051's nature or identity, except by direct assignment by the SCP-5051 Project Head.\n\n\nDescription:\n [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the tablet is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTER\u00a0CREDENTIALS\n\n\n\n\nACCESS\u00a0GRANTED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the file for SCP-5051. If you're cleared to read this, you are now on the SCP-5051 team (and your predecessor (me) is dead.) If not, I'd tell you to stop reading now, but it's probably too late for you anyway. Welcome to Site-97.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I'm sorry.\n\n- SCP-5051 Project Head [DATA LOST]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-5051\n\n\nObject Class:\n Euclid\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n \nSCP-5051 is contained in an isolated chamber in the lowest floor of Provisional Site-273.\n\n\nSCP-5051 is to be contained involving as few humans as possible. Currently, this is achieved with a staff of one person (the Caretaker) caring for SCP-5051 full-time, with assistance by automated systems, which the Caretaker must also be able to maintain.\n\n\nReplacement of SCP-5051's Caretaker is to be undertaken via standard Foundation \"Blind Leading Blind\" protocols, ensuring that only the replacement, and the person who initiated the replacement, are aware that the operation concerns SCP-5051.\n\n\nResearch into preserving or encoding further information about SCP-5051 is encouraged to continue. \nMaybe you won't always have to be alone.\n\n\nUpon induction as SCP-5051's caretaker, all personal history is to be erased, and any personal items with a sentimental connection specifically identifying the Caretaker are to be collected and destroyed if possible.\n\n\nSCP-6465 has been placed within Site-97 for the purposes of medical self-diagnosis and longevity, and has been removed from the Foundation database and the number recycled. When SCP-6465 indicates the Candidate is nearing the end of their lifespan, the Candidate must initiate the replacement process and self-terminate within Room 101 in Site-97. The next Candidate must then clean and repair Room-101.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5051 is a humanoid figure exhibiting a powerful teleohazard.\n1\n\n\nSCP-5051 corrupts any ontological connection or relation between it and any person with a relationship specific to it (e.g. \"SCP-5051's mother\", \"SCP-5051's neighbor\", \"SCP-5051 researcher\").\n\n\nThe degree of this \"corruption\" increases with the length and depth of the connection between SCP-5051 and the target. The connection also does not need to be mutual; connections that only one of the two knows exists have also been affected.\n\n\nThe corruption of these connections manifests as the gradual replacement of shared history. Sentimental items, keepsakes, and mementos generated over the course of the connection lose distinguishing information, degrading into featureless orange orbs. Further corruption results in even shared memories degrading, with the other person only able to recall the image of the orange orbs when pressed about shared events or links to SCP-5051.\n\n\nWhen this connection ends in any manner, SCP-5051's effect annihilates all evidence of the connection outside its own mind. All of the orange orbs detonate explosively, as does the connected person. Additionally, the resulting conceptual \"crater\" prevents any information about or from the connection from being retrieved.\n\n\nInterview Log 5051-A:\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Hello, 5051.\n\n\n(\nSCP-5051 sighs.\n)\n\n\nCaretaker:\n I'm sorry. I don't know your name.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n That's the thing. I don't either. And even if I made up a new one, you'd probably forget it eventually anyway.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Are you sure there's nothing you remember? Anything deep down in there from your past?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n I already told you. It's all gone. Wiped clean. (\npause\n) You don't have to do this, you know.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Do what?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n Try to engage with me or be my friend.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Well, what else am I going to do?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n You could just never come in here, like the last one did. IV nutrition, do all the maintenance while I was asleep.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n I wouldn't- wait. You remember the previous caretaker?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n No.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Then how did you-\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n I don't remember anything about them, but I know I'm older than you. So obviously I had one before you. I can't consciously remember the previous ones, whoever they were, but I know they existed.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Yes, but how do you remember their behavior?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n The crater they left wasn't as big.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n When someone leaves me, and everything goes \"boom\", I feel it. Every single time. It's like a missile strike inside my brain. It burns just trying to remember \nanything\n about that person afterwards, because the metaphorical, or maybe literal, crater is still hot. And the closer I was to that person, the bigger the explosion. I don't want you to get hurt.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n I see.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n Why are you recording this, anyway? It'll be gone when the next person comes.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nInterview Log 5051-B:\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n What do you want?\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Hey, 5051. I've got some questions for you.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n Fine.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Do you have any idea how long you've been in here?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n I- no.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n There's something tripping me up about all this.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n You mean besides being trapped with me in a vault and becoming a ticking time bomb?\n\n\nCaretaker:\n Yeah, besides that.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n Shoot.\n\n\nCaretaker:\n There's no harm in telling \nyou\n this: when I got \"recruited\" or \"assigned\" to this, the documents said that someone had to initiate the replacement process before they died. But how did the first person set up all this secrecy in the first place before they forgot everything?\n\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n\n\n\nInterview 5051-C:\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n(\nFile is heavily corrupted.

I tried to fix this, and all I did was make it worse.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n You know, you used to tell me not to say things like that when you first started here.\n\n\nVoice:\n I did?

But won't it hurt you?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n It doesn't matter, John. You won't be around to know, anyway, and I'm almost starting to get used to it after so many times.\n\n\nVoice:\n How- (\ncoughs\n) how many?\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n Fifty? Fifty-one, maybe.\n\n\nVoice:\n Wait.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n What?\n\n\nVoice:\n Wait wait wait. That can't be right.\n\n\nSCP-5051:\n Well, I've been here longer than you.
