The tracking of abnormal tooth growth in coastal and ocean fauna is to be used to locate its precise whereabouts.\n\n\nOnce SCP-4667 is found and contained, it is to be stationed in a standard humanoid containment chamber located approximately 100m away from any population of organisms possessing teeth. Necessary living procedures, such as feeding, are to be performed by a D-Class which is to have their teeth pulled prior.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4667 is a mute, 26-year-old humanoid female of Soviet descent. SCP-4667 has been diagnosed with total anodontia\n1\n. Organisms possessing deciduous and/or succedaneous teeth in near proximity\n2\n to SCP-4667 will be subjected to a dental-transfigurative effect.\n\n\nSaid organisms' teeth will begin to slowly elongate vertically, with new teeth spontaneously growing directly from the skeletal system, starting from the jawbones. These newly developed teeth will similarly elongate, eventually puncturing through the skin and internal organs. The rate of this effect is sporadic, with current theories suggesting that SCP-4667 is capable of partially controlling the rate of tooth growth.\n\n\nThis effect persists after the subjects are deceased. Organisms affected by SCP-4667 will primarily expire via tooth growths elongating through vital organs, commonly from the teeth in the lower jaw elongating through the roof of the mouth and into the brain. Once affected cadavers leave the presence of SCP-4667, elongated tooth growths will begin to collectively bend and grow into large, intricate models and sculptures of varying subject. The following are known instances of said sculptures:\n\n\n\n\nA feminine winged humanoid, cradling a child. Grown out of a human male.\n\n\nMultiple humanoids, all appear malnourished, and are in positions of anguish. Grown out of a colony of European bats.\n\n\nA larger feminine winged humanoid, its arms are extended out over multiple other humanoids. Grown out of a human male.\n\n\nMultiple humanoids, all appear to be joyous, and are holding objects resembling foodstuffs. Grown out of a human male.\n\n\nMultiple humanoids, all of which in aggressive positions, a winged humanoid is flying away from the aggressive humanoids. Grown out of a human male.\n\n\nA feminine humanoid, noticeably larger and less well-constructed as other instances, is seen crying. Grown out of a human male.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuss Stanford, circa 1977.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough SCP-4667 is known to exist, it has never been in Foundation custody. SCP-4667 originates from Byrkisk, USSR, where it was originally studied by Iosif Jekaterina, a local dentist. SCP-4667's anomalous effects were then reported to an British colleague Russ Stanford.\n\n\nStanford is known to be a leader of GoI-0435, \"The Dentist's Collective of Britain\", a group originally created as a workers union for dentists, but gradually changed their efforts towards the study of anomalous and non-anomalous practices of dentistry and genetic dental disorders.\n\n\nUpon hearing of SCP-4667 and its anomalous effects, Stanford requested for SCP-4667 to be relocated to his office in the United Kingdom. In conjunction with Stanford, Jekaterina procured the British cargo ship SS \nMavis\n via bribery of the ship's crewmen. On 10/19/85, \nMavis\n began sailing to the United Kingdom with SCP-4667 locked in the cargo hold.\n\n\nDuring this, all crewmen succumbed to SCP-4667's effects, with Jekaterina and SCP-4667 disappearing.\n\n\nThe following are notable video surveillance logs aboard \nMavis\n:\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO LOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSS \nMavis\n, sailing away from the USSR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKey:\n\n\n\n\nBoleslav Kondrat - Captain\n\n\nCarlton Tilda - Chief Mate\n\n\nKenelm Hyram - Chief Engineer\n\n\nWilhelm Cale - Second Mate\n\n\nSebastian Wendell - Deckhand\n\n\nIosif Jekaterina - Dentist, Impromptu Ship Doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARGO HOLD - 23:02\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 is in a small room to the side of the cargo hold, Wendell is outside of this room's door. Cale walks by Wendell.\n)\n\n\nCale:\n What's she doing in there?\n\n\nWendell:\n (\nLooks through the door's window.\n) Pacing.\n\n\nCale:\n Still? She said anything?\n\n\nWendell:\n That dentist guy said she's mute. Got's no teeth either.\n\n\nCale:\n Hm, why are we hauling 'er again?\n\n\nWendell:\n Dunno. Have to watch her though. Been standing for a while, chair would be nice.\n\n\nCale:\n I'll see what I can find.\n\n\n(\nCale leaves. Wendell leans against the wall, then begins coughing.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n You OK in there lady? Need anything?\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n Well a nod or something would've been- (\nCoughs.\n), would've been nice.\n\n\n(\nSilence.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n Hey uh, I'll go get some leftovers from supper for yeah soon. Quite famished myself actually.\n\n\n(\nWendell begins coughing once again, this time, coughing up an abnormally long human tooth into his hand. Wendell looks at the tooth, and then through the window towards SCP-4667.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n Oh, thank you.\n\n\n(\nWendell casually puts the tooth back in his mouth, and begins loudly crunching into the tooth, then swallowing it.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n (\nCoughs.\n) No no, no more, I'm good for now.\n\n\n(\nWendell coughs up another abnormally long tooth.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n Well, if you insist.\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE - 22:59\n\n\n(\nKondrat is steering the ship whilst humming. Upon consulting a map, Kondrat's hand appears to cramp.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n (\nGrumbles.\n) -carpal tunnel. Bloody hell, this can't wait a bit?\n\n\n(\nAs Kondrat picks up his pencil, a soft crack is heard, followed by Kondrat jolting back suddenly.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n Fuck! Ow ow, what-\n\n\n(\nKondrat's left index fingernail is seen to be cracked and is bulged outwards.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n What the hell?\n\n\n(\nTilda enters the bridge.\n)\n\n\nTilda:\n Something wrong Boleslav?\n\n\nKondrat:\n My finger, ah, uh, man the ship, I'm gonna talk to that doctor.\n\n\nTilda:\n Oh, wha- (\nCoughs.\n) what happened?\n\n\nKondrat:\n I don't know, I'm just, just gonna go\u2026 (\nTrails off whilst leaving the bridge.\n)\n\n\n\n\nSTATEROOM-A - 23:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIosif Jekaterina, circa 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nJekaterina is writing in journal on his bed, when Kondrat enters.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n Iosif, was it?\n\n\nJekaterina:\n \nDa\n. Something wrong with the ah, girl?\n\n\nKondrat:\n No no, Wendell's looking after 'er. My fucking nail though, it's- (\nShows his nail.\n) I don't know.\n\n\nJekaterina:\n Hm, I see.\n\n\n(\nJekaterina pulls a pair of pliers out of his satchel.\n)\n\n\nJekaterina:\n Hold still, might hurt.\n\n\n(\nKondrat puts his hand down onto a nightstand, where Jekaterina begins removing fingernail fragments. Underneath the fingernail a long human tooth can be seen.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n What- what the fuck\u203d What is-\n\n\nJekaterina:\n Hold still.\n\n\n(\nJekaterina begins plying the tooth out of Kondrat's finger, Kondrat screams obscenities. The tooth cracks out of the finger, which begins bleeding heavily.\n)\n\n\nJekaterina:\n (\nPlaces the tooth onto the nightstand.\n) I get bandages.\n\n\nKondrat:\n What the\u2026 (\nGags.\n) What, what could cause that\u203d\n\n\nJekaterina:\n (\nBegins wrapping Kondrat's finger.\n) Girl is losing control.\n\n\nKondrat:\n The girl? Is, is this why you're here? Why she's here? Some dentist ex-\n\n\nJekaterina:\n I have cared for the girl for a while. She has a ah, gift. She can control, but she is ah, losing control.\n\n\n(\nJekaterina takes a line of measuring tape out of his satchel and puts it against the tooth.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n The bloody hell are you talking about?\n\n\n(\nHyram enters the room.\n)\n\n\nHyram:\n Hey uh- wait, what happened to y-\n\n\nKondrat:\n This isn't the time Kenelm, yo-\n\n\nHyram:\n Man it's important, the ship, she's going too fast.

Hope your finger gets better.\n\n\n(\nHyram exits.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n Now what're you saying before?\n\n\nJekaterina:\n I know not much, British comrade Russ knows mores than I. When ashore he will explain better.\n\n\nKondrat:\n Well what \ndo\n yeah know?\n\n\nJekaterina:\n She grows teeth. That is all. Not even name.\n\n\nKondrat:\n Teeth?\n\n\nJekaterina:\n Look at teeth I pulled. How long is now?\n\n\nKondrat:\n 32 millimeters?\n\n\nJekaterina:\n Incisor should be about 22 millimeters.\n\n\nKondrat:\n (\nSarcastically.\n) Oh, so \nthat's\n what's wrong with this?\n\n\nJekaterina:\n Tooth is now 33 millimeters. Been biting tongue a lot as of late?\n\n\nKondrat:\n Uh, we- we should check on Wendell.\n\n\nJekaterina:\n You go. I must stay and study.\n\n\nKondrat:\n Alright, stay safe.\n\n\nJekaterina:\n I will.\n\n\n(\nKondrat leaves.\n)\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE - 23:21\n\n\n(\nWhat is believed to be Tilda is present at the wheel. Tilda has copious amounts of elongated tooth growths surrounding their entire body, which are intertwining with the controls for the ship. Tilda is not moving.\n)\n\n\n(\nHyram is seen in the hallway to the bridge. Upon seeing Tilda, he begins to back away. Hyram then faints, several minutes after this, assorted crackling can be heard. a puddle of blood then begins to form under Hyram.\n)\n\n\n\n\nCARGO HOLD - 23:30\n\n\n(\nWendell is seen chewing, however no crunching can be heard.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n (\nNoticeably slurred.\n) Got anymore?\n\n\n(\nCale enters.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n Oh hey Will! Got any teeth to spare?\n\n\nCale:\n What the hell? What happened to-\n\n\nWendell:\n Actually, wait.\n\n\n(\nWendell reaches into his eye socket with two of his fingers, and removes a elongated tooth carefully.\n)\n\n\nWendell:\n I still got some lying around. (\nChuckles.\n)\n\n\n(\nKondrat enters. Wendell puts the tooth into his mouth and continues chewing.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n Wendell, what was that?\n\n\nCale:\n He's eating his bloody teeth Boleslav!\n\n\nWendell:\n (\nChuckles.\n) Tastes better than your cooking.\n\n\nKondrat:\n What? Wendell, the girl-\n\n\nWendell:\n Oh don't worry, I'm a watching 'er still.\n\n\nKondrat:\n No, Wendell, she's messing with you, you, you ain't supposed to have teething coming outta your eyes like this! You realize that, right?\n\n\nWendell:\n Hm, since when?\n\n\n(\nTooth fragments in Wendell's stomach suddenly elongate, puncturing through his abdomen and shirt. Wendell collapses.\n)\n\n\nCale:\n Fuck, Wendell! What a-\n\n\nKondrat:\n Ge- get the keys. We're throwing the bitch overboard.\n\n\n(\nCale takes keys off of Wendell. As Cale brings the keys to the door, a tooth elongates out of the tip of his index finger, impaling his thumb and causing him to drop the keys.\n)\n\n\nCale:\n Shit!\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 reaches under the door and grabs the keys.\n)\n\n\nKondrat:\n You- (\nLaughs.\n) you can't unlock the door from that way you bloody walnut!\n\n\n\n\nCARGO HOLD:SIDEROOM - 23:36\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 throws the key across the room. SCP-4667 then begins staring at the door, as it does, screaming can be heard from the other side for several minutes. teeth elongation can be seen through the windows. Screaming stops after approximately 30 seconds.\n)\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 looks away from the door, teeth outside stop growing. SCP-4667 moves to a corner of the room and looks at the ceiling, which is noticeably convex. Ceiling begins cracking and bulging farther down. Teeth are seen breaking through the roof, until the roof collapses, with the body of Hyram falling down with it. Hyram's back is severely affected by tooth growths. As the roof collapses, the camera is destroyed.\n)\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE - 23:40\n\n\n(\nLow fuel signifiers are blinking, and a hole is now present in the hallway. SCP-4667 emerges from this hole on a pillar of elongated teeth, which slowly rises upwards. SCP-4667 walks off of this pillar, and onto the bridge, where it exits onto the deck through a side door.\n)\n\n\n\n\nDECK - 23:41\n\n\n(\nJekaterina is seen setting up a lifeboat, SCP-4667 enters the deck.\n)\n\n\nJekaterina:\n (\nIn Russian.\n) You know I care about you and your craft, unlike these others. I will await your reclamation, I hope my service was satisfactory.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 continues to stare at Jekaterina for a couple seconds, then goes back into the bridge. Jekaterina hastily leaves on a lifeboat minutes after.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 10/21/85, \nMavis\n washed ashore on the east coast of the United Kingdom. After which, Stanford and the majority of GoI-0435 went to the site of the shipwreck. It is unknown how the group knew of the location of \nMavis\n at the time. Multiple objects were recovered at the scene, including the bodies of all of \nMavis\n's crewmen, a photo, and a broken film camera, still recording.\n\n\nThe following is a log of the recovered recording, along with the recovered photograph:\n\n\n\n\n(\nRecorder is walking through a field. Stanford is seen to the side, along with various others.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovered photograph. The phrase: \"Dentists meeting, 1981, we grow stronger everyday.\", is written on the back. Stanford can be seen at the end of the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorder:\n How yeah know she's here Russ?\n\n\nStanford:\n Spoke to me last night. She wants us to see. Keep the film steady, others'll want to see this.\n\n\n(Mavis \nis seen in the background, Stanford begins running towards the wreck.\n)\n\n\nStanford:\n Are you in there?\n\n\n(\nAssorted muttering from others.\n)\n\n\nStanford:\n This, this is the ship, alright? SS \nMavis\n, see? That's the one Iosif bribed. Did, did you leave already?\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 is now seen on the ship's deck.\n)\n\n\nStanford:\n There! Yes, Ivadente, we have studied your craft, your divine work. We have heard your cries in the teeth of our patients. Not all of us forsake your gift, not all.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 smirks.\n)\n\n\nStanford:\n I have done as you said, have y-\n\n\n(\nA large pair of avian wings made solely out of elongated and normal sized teeth unfurl from SCP-4667's back. It is unclear what holds these wings together.\n)\n\n\nStanford:\n Oh, yes of course, for your wings, so that was why.\n\n\n(\nGoI-0435 collectively bows.\n)\n\n\nStanford:\n Go make your gift clear, Ivadente. Make it clear to the over-lookers.\n\n\n(\nSCP-4667 lifts itself into the air, and flies towards the mainland. As SCP-4667 goes out of frame, GoI-0435 begins to slowly walk towards the direction SCP-4667 flew. Recorder drops the camera and does not appear to notice. GoI-0435 is heard silently walking into the distance.\n)\n\n\n\n\nAfter this event, the whereabouts for any member of GOI-0435 became unknown. SCP-4667 remains at large.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
