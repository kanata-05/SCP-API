Though its anomalous properties are presumed to be no longer extant, any personnel interacting with SCP-2741 should avoid inserting their hands into the device unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2741 is a crude wooden box, 40cm in height and width and 1m long. On either side of the box are two holes, labelled LEFT and RIGHT respectively, with rubber gloves fixed to the box inside; wearing the gloves reveals a large button by the fingers on each side. The top of the box is dominated by a plastic skull; in the mouth of the skull is a speaker, and behind it is a slot for a AA battery and an on/off switch.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 2741-01\n\n\nSubject:\n D-582\n\n\nProcedure:\n D-582 was instructed to switch on SCP-2741.
