It is to maintain a 1km perimeter surrounding SCP-4070-A at all times.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4070 is a phenomenon wherein affected autonomous automobiles (SCP-4070-1 instances) ignore user input and instead converge on SCP-4070-A.\n\n\nSCP-4070-A is the target of SCP-4070-1 instances. Current calculations indicate that upon startup, an autonomous automobile has a (100/e^x)% chance of becoming an SCP-4070-1 instance (where x equals the distance between the automobile and SCP-4070-A in kilometers). SCP-4070-1 instances will travel in a straight line\n1\n toward SCP-4070-A.\n\n\nDue to the relative scarcity of self-driving automobiles until recently, it is unknown when SCP-4070 manifested. However, due to the history of SCP-4070-A, a starting date of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1983 has been proposed.\n\n\nAddendum-4070-1: Discovery Log:\n SCP-4070 was discovered when a [REDACTED] brand self-driving vehicle in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, England experienced the effect of SCP-4070 upon starting, driving into the ocean and killing 3 passengers.\n\n\nAnalysis of the car's data found that its safety measures had been disabled and it was driving towards GPS coordinates corresponding to a point in Bangor, Maine, USA. This was later confirmed to correspond to the exact location of SCP-4070-A at the time. Later tests confirmed anomalous properties of SCP-4070-A.\n\n\nAddendum-4070-2:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1999, SCP-4070-A was involved in a human-on-vehicle collision, sending SCP-4070-A into a nearby ditch. SCP-4070-A suffered a fractured hip, multiple fractures to its right leg, and a collapsed lung.\n\n\nFollowing a comprehensive Foundation investigation into this incident, it was determined that SCP-4070 was uninvolved.\n\n\nAddendum-4070-3:\n On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2019, a space rocket fired by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 company in 2018 with a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 brand vehicle onboard was confirmed to be undergoing a travel path unintended by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 corporation. Instead of travelling to [REDACTED] as intended, the space rocket used its remaining fuel to change course towards SCP-4070-A. Current projections indicate this will result in a direct collision with asteroid-41970-A455 and is not expected to pose a threat to human life.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
