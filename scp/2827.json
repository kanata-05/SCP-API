While the possibility of tampering or sabotage has not been ruled out, it is currently believed that information about SCP-2827 is inherently unstable and subject to unpredictable, erratic changes. Although no major cognitohazards have been associated with this entry, it is advised that you proceed with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n SCP-2827 \nLeviticus 11:12\n\n\nObject Class:\n [Pending]\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\n Provisional Exclusion Zone-2827 has been established in a 3km radius around SCP-2827's current location, using a hazardous waste disposal area as a front.\n\n\nFurther containment procedures cannot be enacted until more information is known about SCP-2827. As such, research is to continue as a Delta-class priority to the Foundation.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2827 is an entity that currently inhabits a 2m\n2\n plot of grass. It is unpredictably variable in its abilities, size, mass, radioactivity, sentience, sapience, toxicity, mobility, speed, hostility, and other qualities.\n\n\n43 separate tests have been conducted by the Foundation to determine the properties of SCP-2827, which resulted in 13 fatalities of researchers (as well as [REDACTED] fatalities of D-class personnel). As such, Dr. Jacobs, PEZ-2827 Site Director, has determined only two consistent factors regarding the nature of SCP-2827:\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2827 possesses anomalous destructive capabilities.\n\n\nThe physical appearance of SCP-2827 is that of a member of the Nephropidae family of crustaceans, also known as lobsters. (The exact species of lobster is indeterminable at this time.)\n\n\n\n\nFurther information regarding SCP-2827 has yet to be determined, pending research.\n\n\nPartial Activity Log:\n\n\n\n\nIncident-2827-1: 3/13/07:\n SCP-2827 materializes instantaneously in the Gulf of Mexico. The entire state of California \nis destroyed\n/\nbecomes an independent monarchy\n/\nhas nothing to do with SCP-2827\n/\nretroactively materializes on the west coast of the United States of America, resulting in a PK-class Causal Energy Feedback Crisis that incinerates the entire city of Pacifica Beach, Nevada\n[The objective results of Incident-2827-1 are still unknown, pending further investigation.]\n\n\n3/\n58\n 23/07:\n SCP-2827 emits a constant, 127\u00a0dB shriek for approximately three hours. \nGentlemen, we have failed.\n\n\n[DATA CORRUPTED]:\n SCP-2827 begins a three-year period of \ndormancy\n.\n\n\n44/55/66:\n [DATA CORRUPTED]\n\n\n\n\nNot this shit again. Alright, I'll have Attempt #74 up by the end of the month. I assure you, I'm just as frustrated as you are with this damn lobster. \u2014Head Researcher Naismith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Incident\u00a02827-142\u00a0-\u00a04/2827\u00a0clearance\u00a0required\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0encryption\u00a0key\u00a0accepted\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/24/14 at 12:39 PM, SCP-2827 displayed signs of physical discomfort. At the same time, a sealed envelope was discovered in the Director's office at PEZ-2827. Within the envelope was a letter containing three similar (but not identical) separate messages written in Swedish, French, and English:\n\n\n\n\nJag ber om urs\u00e4kt f\u00f6r de problem jag har orsakat er.\n\nDet d\u00e4r var en l\u00f6gn.\n\n\nJag kan lova er tv\u00e5 utmaningar, eftersom ni \u00e4r s\u00e5 svaga allihop:\n\n1.
