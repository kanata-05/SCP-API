For accurate and rigorous testing, however, it is required that the object is kept in a room with at least 2 metres of clearance in each direction for movement of testing equipment, and is supported at least 30cm off the ground by 4 clear Perspex rods, one mounted at each corner of the base. The base is to be mounted upon a weighing apparatus which is connected to an alarm; the alarm is to sound if the weight of the object changes by more than 0.4%.\n1\n Endoscopy equipment is to be stored in the storage area\u2019s equipment locker at all times when not in use.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1140 is a chest of 7 drawers painted with clear gloss varnish over oak. The chest is 148cm in width, 49cm in depth and 91cm in height. The drawers' dimensions are (top to bottom):\n\n\n\n\nThree drawers 46cm wide, 21cm tall and 46cm deep\n\n\nTwo drawers 70cm wide, 21cm tall and 46cm deep\n\n\nTwo drawers 70cm wide, 31cm tall and 46cm deep\n\n\n\n\nThe anomalous behaviour is observed when the central drawer in the top row of the chest is opened at least 2cm, whereby under certain circumstances vocalisation can be detected from within the chest. This vocalisation has been designated SCP-1140-1. Testing has shown that the circumstances include the presence of a single prepubescent child, the presence of a single post-pubescent who has significant mental retardation\n2\n, or any adult who has assisted with [REDACTED].\n3\n\n\nDismantling the chest has revealed there to be nothing within the cavity behind the drawers capable of producing vocalisation; presence of speakers or any other electromagnetic equipment capable of playback has been ruled out by use of metal-detection apparatus. As the anomalous vocalisation only occurs when a single individual is present, remote-control equipment must be used during testing. Presence of the equipment seems to have no effect on testing.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-1140-1 is for all experimental considerations a disembodied voice, any attempts to reach towards the rear of the drawer during such time as the voice can be heard results in injury. This appears to only occur to live human beings, and does not occur when SCP-1140-1 is inactive. The wounds are consistent with having been caused by a large claw, and are most similar in pathology to wounds caused by a large ratite (ostrich, emu, or cassowary).\n\n\nRecovery Log:\n The item was recovered from the dining area of a house in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588. The house was otherwise unremarkable; after application of Class A amnestics and neurolinguistic programming by a field agent, the family remain in-situ, with the chest having been replaced by a non-anomalous replica.\n\n\nSCP-1140 came to the attention of a researcher during periodic checking of psychiatric reports,\n4\n and a field agent was sent out to interview both the report's subject and his family. Interviews revealed that the youngest member of the household had been found on several occasions sitting on the floor near to SCP-1140 and having conversations with what the family believed to be an 'imaginary friend'. The amount of time that the child spent doing this, in addition to his refusing to move for hours, resulted in him being reviewed by a child psychiatrist.\n\n\n\n\nRecovery\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Interview\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt (0:11:12 to 0:13:42) from Recovery Interview 1140-A5 (\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 6yo male):\n\n\nAgent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n When did you first start hearing the voice?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n I heard him talking to me when I walked past him once.\n\n\nAgent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Can you remember how old you were?\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Oh, it was after my birthday party.
