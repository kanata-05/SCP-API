If such a gateway is formed, Mobile Task Force Tau-16 is to be dispatched. Consult document 2336-N for details of engagement protocol for the Type I and Type II entities that typically arrive through such a gateway.\n\n\nNote: See supplemental containment procedures in Addendum 1 below.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2336 is a sequence of phonemes, not known to correspond to any meaning in any living or known extinct language. Document 2336-A contains a representation of SCP-2336 in the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n\n\nThe vocal articulation of this phoneme sequence by a human subject has been experimentally demonstrated to result in the formation of a Howard-Stross gateway\n1\n normally having a duration of 2 to 11 seconds. The formation of such a gateway frequently results in the arrival of a Type I or Type II tartarean entity (designated an instance of SCP-2336-A).\n\n\nAlthough instances of SCP-2336-A are frequently hostile, \nthrough trial and error\n the Foundation has developed a reliable protocol for containing them, communicating with them, documenting their characteristics, and (most recently) controlling them and applying their capabilities toward research purposes and other useful activities.\n2\n An excerpt of the containment and processing log for instances of SCP-2336-A follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nApplication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A1\n\n\nNon-sapient hexapod, mass approx. 1800\u00a0kg. Emits slime composed of high concentrations of sulfur and phosphorus.\n\n\nMilked for chemical compounds for research and industrial use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A8\n\n\nNon-sapient tetrapod with body plan superficially resembling a rhinoceros. Mass approx. 1200\u00a0kg. Body temperature in excess of 260\u00a0\u00b0C. Breathes fire.\n\n\nPowers turbine to supply electricity to Site 38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A72\n\n\nSapient. Invisible (body plan assumed to be bipedal and winged). Capable of communicating in classical Arabic. During interviews, claims to be composed of \"smokeless flame of fire.\" Capable of levitating.\n\n\nContainment chamber integrated into elevator at Site 32 to economize energy use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A210\n\n\nSapient biped. Reddish hide.\n\n\nUsed as gas filter in modified Maxwell engine to overcome thermodynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A322\n\n\nSapient biped. Iridescent hide.\n\n\nConsciousness imprinted into Laplace processor for computational purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A416\n\n\nSemi-sapient with irregular body plan. Capable of summoning an apparently unlimited supply of live, non-anomalous \nMusca domestica\n from unknown source.\n\n\nFlies crushed and processed for use as fertilizer and for other industrial purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2336-A666\n\n\nSapient biped. Interviews indicate that SCP-2336-A666 occupies a position of authority in the society accessed by means of the gateway.\n\n\nAfter negotiation, exchanged for recovery of personnel who had been lost during a containment breach of \nSCP-1844\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n Further research indicates that under certain conditions, a vocal articulation of SCP-2336 is likely to result in a much larger Howard-Stross gateway, thereby presenting a risk that a much larger tartarean entity (possibly one or more Type VIII entities) could manifest. Analysis indicates that three exacerbating factors are:\n\n\n\n\nProximity of the human subject to (\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0 N, \u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0 E) at the time that SCP-2336 is articulated (that location is designated as Location K)\n\n\nWhether the human subject is a member of Y-chromosomal haplogroup \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nAstronomical conditions specified in Appendix 2336-S.\n\n\n\n\nThe manifestation of even one Type VIII entity would presumably constitute a Category 7 (XK) eschatologic condition. To mitigate risk, supplemental containment procedures have been adopted in order to lessen the risk that SCP-2336 could be articulated under conditions when one or more of the risk factors are present.\n\n\n\n\nAccess to Location K has been restricted by placing a landfill at the site.\n\n\nThe Foundation has developed a teratogen and introduced it to the water supply in the geographic area where most of the population of haplogroup \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 resides, for the purpose of causing individuals born in that area to have congenital anatomical defects which render them physically unable to vocalize the phonemes.\n\n\nProposals to address astronomical conditions are under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
