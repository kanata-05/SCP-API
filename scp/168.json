It should be propped at the full angle that its casing allows, facing the unshuttered window provided. The entrance is to remain locked, with entrance available by request. Based on prior research, it is not to be used as a normal calculator would. Discussion with SCP-168 is encouraged, but is to be limited to a maximum of one hour per day; no exceptions.\n\n\nDescription:\n Found resting on a desk during clearance of the condemned \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Elementary School building in 199\u2588, SCP-168 is a Hewlett-Packard brand graphing calculator, model #HP-28C. Upon initial inspection, it was discovered that the name \u201cEric\u201d was carved into the inside of the removable casing. However, upon inputting a simple equation (6\u00f73) and pressing the \u201c=\u201d button, the screen of the device went blank for 3 minutes and 34 seconds, after which the \u201calternate key\u201d function engaged, displaying the message; \u201cWHAT TIME IS IT?\u201d\n\n\nFor a log of the conversation, those with Level 2 Security Clearance should see Addendum: Report E-12.\n\n\nThough not altogether mobile, SCP-168 has displayed signs of action when personnel are not present. It also possesses both vision and hearing, though how these processes work is currently unknown. For more information, refer to Addendum: Report E-18. This evidence has led to petitioning to upgrade the object to Euclid class, justifying more secure arrangements for containment.\n\n\nDocument #168-1:\n Interview E-12\n\n\nRecorded log of dialogue between SCP-168 and Dr. Howard, dated January 14, 2008:\n\n\n(Replies from SCP-168 are to remain capitalized, to indicate non-vocal communication and preserve authenticity. SCP-168 is also incapable of forming punctuation marks, save for period, comma, and question mark)\n\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\nDr. Howard\n: Can you hear me?\n\n\nSCP-168\n: YES.\n\n\nDr. Howard\n: Do you have a name?\n\n\nSCP-168\n: CALCULATOR?\n\n\nDr. Howard\n: May I call you 168?\n\n\nSCP-168\n: I DONT SEE WHY NOT.\n\n\nDr. Howard\n: Good.
