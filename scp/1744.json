A security perimeter is to be maintained at all times; unauthorized individuals attempting to access SCP-1744 are to be turned away.\n\n\nThe manifestation of SCP-1744-1 instances is to be immediately reported to appropriate Site-39 personnel; instances of SCP-1744-1 are to be retrieved and stored in a video-monitored testing room equipped with highly-sensitive recording microphones. Any changes in the physical appearance of SCP-1744-1 instances are to be noted.\n\n\nAccess to instances of SCP-1744-1 is restricted to Level 3 personnel. The remains of expired instances of SCP-1744-1 are to be stored in a standard storage locker in Site-39.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1744 is a shallow pond, located approximately \u2588\u2588 meters from Site-39. SCP-1744 measures approximately 10 meters wide and 4 meters deep at its deepest point. The surface of the water in SCP-1744 remains relatively placid regardless of wind conditions, and only becomes agitated when physical contact is applied. Chemical analysis of the water indicates no abnormalities, save for a slightly elevated salt content (compared to that of fresh water).\n\n\nSCP-1744 will periodically produce \nSinum perspectivum\n (white Baby\u2019s Ear) seashells, referred to as SCP-1744-1. Instances of SCP-1744-1 will manifest floating on the surface of the water, and upon initial appearance, seem to be undamaged. A significant percentage of SCP-1744-1 instances will undergo deterioration over time, sometimes to the point of shattering. Rarely, instances of SCP-1744-1 will dissolve into fine sand instead of shattering into fragments. The means and process by which this occurs is currently unknown.\n\n\nRecords indicate that SCP-1744 initially manifested seven months after Site-39 was founded, following Incident \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588 involving SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Although it is presumed that this was a result, researchers have not determined a causative correlation. The cause and origin of the instances of SCP-1744-1 are unknown; the first instance of SCP-1744-1 was retrieved three hours after SCP-1744's initial appearance.\n\n\nWhen an instance of SCP-1744-1 is destroyed (whether due to time or physical force), a clear-speaking voice will emanate from the shell fragments. Multiple voices have been noted, although thus far no recorded voice has been observed more than once.\n\n\n\n\nPartial Log of SCP-1744-1 instance recordings:\n\n\nInstance Discovery: 03/25/1981\n\nRecording Date: 10/12/1984 (instance deteriorated in containment)\n\nVoice: female, believed to be young adult\n\nTranscript of Recording: \u201cThings have been getting steadily worse, there\u2019s no denying it. I\u2019ve thought over everything, worried through every night, and I don\u2019t see a way out this time.\u201d\n\n\nInstance Discovery: 05/12/1989\n\nRecording Date: 08/24/1995 (instance destroyed as part of experiment)\n\nVoice: male, believed to be elderly adult\n\nTranscript of Recording: \u201cI keep waking up in more pain than before. It hurts, I tell them, but they keep saying I can be strong and do more. People say they need me, but I don\u2019t really want this. I\u2019ve passed the point of not caring, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\nInstance Discovery: 12/14/2000\n\nRecording Date: 01/03/2001 (instance deteriorated in containment)\n\nVoice: indistinguishable gender, believed to be a child\n\nTranscript of Recording: \u201cI hope father and mother know it\u2019s their fault. They keep trying to tell me to do well and be successful. Maybe I don\u2019t want that. Maybe I want to be happy. Maybe I want them to notice me.\u201d\n\n\nInstance Discovery: 05/20/2002\n\nRecording Date: 05/20/2003 (instance deteriorated in containment)\n\nVoice: female, believed to be in late teens\n\nTranscript of Recording: \u201cIt\u2019s that day again. I wonder if anyone knows, because no one says they blame me. I was the one who wasn\u2019t careful, I was the one who thought it\u2019d be harmless, it\u2019d be fun, and we\u2019d all laugh about it later. Everyone thinks I\u2019m just missing my friends, but I\u2019m too selfish for that, I\u2019ve always only thought of myself.\u201d\n\n\nInstance Discovery: 04/18/2013\n\nRecording Date: 04/24/2013 (instance destroyed as part of experiment)\n\nVoice: male, believed to be middle-aged adult\n\nTranscript of Recording: \u201cAfter so long, I\u2019m finally able to sleep peacefully again. The research is going well. I can\u2019t wait to see my family again, I\u2019m sure the twins have grown.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 1744-1:\n Recent suicide rate statistics of the urban areas surrounding Site-39 have demonstrated patterns consistent with Foundation testing of SCP-1744-1 instances. \nHowever, the losses have been deemed acceptable, and until the range of SCP-1744\u2019s effect is determined, testing involving SCP-1744-1 is to continue as scheduled.\n See Addendum 1744-2.\n\n\nAddendum 1744-2:\n Due to the as-yet unexplained suicide of Researcher E\u2588\u2588\u2588 S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and recent disappearance of Dr. H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588, instances of SCP-1744-1 are no longer to be destroyed as part of experimental procedures. All Site-39 personnel are now required to take part in a mandatory psychological evaluation following each new appearance of an instance of SCP-1744-1.\n\n\nSome instances of SCP-1744-1 have been observed to intermittently emit vocalizations, which can only be observed when one holds the shell to their ear. It has been noted that the voices produced by SCP-1744-1 are observed to sound distorted, as if through water. However, the more wear the instance exhibits, the clearer the vocalizations become.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpt from journal log of Dr. H\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 L\u2588\u2588:\n\n\n07/15/2009: A new instance of SCP-1744-1 was reported. I went to take a look at it, since it was the first we\u2019d seen in weeks.\n\n\n11/24/2010: Work is stressful and busy, and I haven\u2019t had much time to write, what with life moving (or ending) so unexpectedly as of late. I\u2019ve kept listening to the shell, gotten authorization once a week, but I\u2019ve heard nothing particularly of note. I feel like the whisperings are familiar, somehow.\n\n\n09/19/2011: Been spacing out listening sessions with the shell to avoid it affecting me mentally. Still, the voice is clearer, someone I\u2019m sure I know, perhaps in the family. I\u2019d better check up on them.\n\n\n04/10/2013: I recognized the voice, at last. It\u2019s mine. And as of today, there\u2019s a rather noticeable crack running across the surface of the shell.\n\n\n04/25/2013: They found E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s body yesterday, a few hours after I smashed the shell that only then spoke with his voice. I didn\u2019t know. He seemed fine. The few shells we could link to people always belonged to those outside the facility.\n\n\nI received a phone call. It happened. She didn't make it. Tonight, I\u2019ve decided on tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1743\n | SCP-1744 | \nSCP-1745\n \u00bb",
