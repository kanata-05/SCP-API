A small space beneath SCP-3964 has been excavated and converted into Site-\u2588\u2588-B with access available only to authorized personnel.\n\n\nAll personnel assigned to Site-\u2588\u2588-B must first pass a psychiatric screening\n1\n before being permitted access to the site. Anyone who has not undergone the screening process is barred from Site-\u2588\u2588-B unless permitted otherwise by the Senior Researcher for testing purposes. Re-screenings are mandatory and must be given once every two weeks to avoid incident, or if there is cause to believe additional screenings are necessary; at which time the suspected personnel(s) will be redirected to the psych ward to be evaluated.\n\n\nA therapist must be available on-site at all times.\n\n\nDirect access to SCP-3964 must be monitored at all times.\n\n\nIn the event that an unauthorized personnel or civilian enters Site-\u2588\u2588-B, they are to be detained and administered a Class-A amnestic. They may then be released back into the public. If they manage to gain access to SCP-3964, depending if anomalous activity is observed and subject survives, amnestics Classes A through D are authorized for use after detainment and debriefing. They may then be released back into the public.\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Community College and its library will remain open for the perceivable future. No anomalous activities have been observed outside of the western library stairwell. Nonetheless, the eastern stairwell, and in extension, all stairwells present on campus, are to be kept under constant surveillance.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3964 is a library stairwell, located at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Community College, that functions as designed under normal circumstances. When any person with a prior history of significant suicidal ideation (henceforth referred to as an SCP-3964-2 instance) enters SCP-3964, it will activate and transport the SCP-3964-2 instance to SCP-3964-1. Individuals without suicidal thoughts and tendencies will pass through SCP-3964 without incident.\n\n\nSCP-3964-1 is a pocket dimension consisting of a single stairwell, without a discovered exit. No lower or upper limit to SCP-3964-1 has been found. When an individual enters SCP-3964-1, they will remain in the extradimensional space until they choose to jump from the railing of the stairwell. In most cases, this results in the SCP-3964-2 instance to fall to their death. To date, there have been \u2588 recorded exceptions to this rule.\n\n\nSCP-3964-1 contains the means to indefinitely sustain basic human needs. Each floor is equipped with a bathroom, water fountain, and a snack vending machine. Vending machines operate normally and still require monetary input to dispense product. Instances of SCP-3964-2 have been recorded to use blunt force to break the protective glass to obtain food in the absence of money.\n\n\nTime within SCP-3964-1 behaves in an inconsistent manner. The amount of time experienced by instances of SCP-3964-2 within the extradimensional space does not appear to correlate with the amount of time they are perceived to spend on the stairwell by outside observers. Additionally, testing has revealed physical signs of aging relative to the amount of time perceived by SCP-3964-2 instances, as opposed to expected aging rates in normal spacetime.\n\n\nAddendum.1:\n The first record of anomalous behavior is traced to [DATA EXPUNGED] after the opening of the campus. It is unknown whether this incident was the cause of or a consequence of SCP-3964. The civilian student involved had jumped to his death from the top of the stairwell. The cause of death was severe head trauma, consistent with a fall of 25 meters\n2\n. Investigation revealed a history of depression.\n\n\nSimilar cases followed for \u2588\u2588 years after the initial incident. Witnesses describe the suicides as \u201cspontaneous\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d, but the Foundation had no evidence to suspect that this might be a site of an anomaly. After several years, SCP-3964 was being referred to as the \"Suicide Staircase\" by the student body.\n\n\nSCP-3964 first came to the attention of the Foundation following Incident-3964-1. A caucasian woman (designated SCP-3964-2-A) was observed to have used SCP-3964 to walk from the first floor to the second landing where she then jumped and landed unharmed on the floor below. In attempts to describe the experience to others a field agent assigned to the area learned of the SCP-3964-2-A's experience within SCP-3964-1 and notified the Foundation. SCP-3964-2-A was then detained, debriefed, and given a Class-C amnestic before release. A notebook recording her experiences of her time in SCP-3964-1 was collected for study along with her cellphone and other belonging. Afterwards, the Foundation bricked off SCP-3964 and built Site-\u2588\u2588-B.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Transcription\u00a0of\u00a0notebook\u00a0confiscated\u00a0after\u00a0Incident-3964-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Transcription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know where I am.\n\n\nI mean\u2026 This shouldn\u2019t be possible right? I was only trying to get to the second floor of the library and now I\u2019m stuck in some endless loop of stairs. It\u2019s been about an hour that I\u2019ve been walking around and nothing. It\u2019s just endless floor after floor. When I lean over the edge it just seems to stretch on forever and ever in both directions and I get this weird pull in my gut. You know, that weird feeling you get standing super close to the edge that just kinda whispers \u201cjump\u201d? It\u2019s unnerving so I\u2019m going to stay away from the edge from now on. I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ve tried the doors on either side of each floor but they\u2019re all locked. This is scary. Which is why I guess I\u2019m writing in you. There\u2019s no reception in here either. There\u2019s nothing here except the thoughts in my head. I keep thinking I\u2019m going to run into someone, that I\u2019ll hear someone. Sometimes I think I do hear something but it\u2019s just silent. But like a loud silence ya know? Heavy and stuff. It doesn\u2019t help that it feels air conditioned in here despite the fact that I haven\u2019t seen a single vent or air conditioner. I tried shouting but my voice just echoes on until it fades away. That\u2019s a little spooky so I don't think I\u2019ll try it again. Besides, what would I even do if someone answered? Something? I don\u2019t even want to think about it. This place doesn\u2019t feel natural, it obviously isn\u2019t, so I don\u2019t want to push my luck.\n\n\nI also think I\u2019m going to start counting floors. Idk how many floors I\u2019ve already walked down so I\u2019m just going to count this as number 1 and go from there. I\u2019ll start heading up again since going down doesn\u2019t seem to be working.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n We suspect SCP-3964-2-A was walking down in an attempt to find where she entered. At the bottom of the page she drew the number 1 in bubble-letter font.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m on floor 206, it\u2019s been 6 hours, and my phone battery is going to die soon but I\u2019m dying of boredom. I decided to just fuck it and play a few games but that drained my battery a lot. I probably shouldn\u2019t have done that because I just realized there aren\u2019t any clocks in here and my phone is my only source of telling time. And even though counting the floors and hours is making me crazy I think it\u2019ll be even worse without knowing the time. I\u2019m so fucking stupid. I\u2019m just going to leave it on low battery mode and hope for the best. I doubt it\u2019ll survive another 6 hours though.\n\n\nI\u2019m also super exhausted. It\u2019s about 8\u00a0o\u2019clock now and I got up at like 4 and all this walking is tiring. Maybe whatever trapped me in here is trying to make me exercise? Well. Whatever it is I don\u2019t really want to go to sleep. And there isn\u2019t even anything suitable to sleep on. I guess I could collect a bunch of paper towels from each floor and make a bed? But what if something creeps up on me while I\u2019m sleeping? I doubt I could sleep anyways. I guess\u2026 I\u2019ll just keep walking until I pass out from exhaustion. There\u2019s nothing better to do.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n At the bottom of the page she drew a rococo-styled 206. The next few pages are filled with miscellaneous doodles.\n\n\n\n\nI think I\u2019m going to die in here. I finally gave up last night and slept in one of the bathrooms, which was the only place I could turn off the damn lights. I did collect a bunch of paper towels and made a bed and used my jacket and backpack as well. It\u2019s about 3 in the morning now and I can\u2019t sleep anymore. I still feel exhausted but my mind won\u2019t let me rest. I\u2019m also starving. I just realized that I didn\u2019t eat last night. I guess the good thing is that nothing has attacked me yet which either means there\u2019s nothing but me in here or whatever is out there is trying to lull me into a sense of comfort. I\u2019m honestly not sure which I would prefer at this point. I just wish if there really is some monster it\u2019ll just get it over with an kill me now. All this waiting is unbearable.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a vending machine on every floor, all with the same snacks (there are some tuna salad sandwiches so that\u2019s good), but I don\u2019t have that much cash on me. If I don\u2019t get out of here today I\u2019ll just have to smash them open with something. There are a few fire extinguishers around so I\u2019ll probably just use one of those or something. At least there\u2019s water fountains so I don\u2019t dehydrate but apparently even in weird limbo spaces water fountains are still disgusting as hell.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n She drew a swirly 257 at the bottom of this page. Our lab found traces of bread crumbs suggesting she ate while reading this over.\n\n\n\n\nThis is floor 413\u2026 I think. I\u2019m starting to lose track. The silence and the cold air is numbing my mind. I might\u2019ve skipped counting a few floors or lost count somewhere. I can\u2019t be sure. I have a sharpie so I think I\u2019ll start writing the floor numbers on the water fountains because it\u2019s a shiny eye catching place. Maybe I should leave little messages if anyone else gets stuck here? I hope no one else gets stuck in here but I mean\u2026 I might as well right? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got anything better to do.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n She drew an interesting looking 413 at the bottom of the page, next to a small doodle of some cartoon character wearing triangular sunglasses. Dr. Robert informs me that this is a reference to something called Homestuck.\n\n\n\n\nSOMEONE ELSE WAS HERE.\n\n\nThey left a note! It\u2019s written in lipstick on the mirror in the bathroom which is a little disconcerting but it means I\u2019m not the only one! I took a picture of it on my phone, which is now at 3%, but I think it was still a worthy use of the battery life. I wish I remembered to bring my charger this morning. It occurred to me while I was eating breakfast that the vending machines use outlets. But I don\u2019t have my charger anyways so the point is moot. Anyways, the note reads \u201cFuck this sexist place. No tampons.\u201d\n\n\nWhich I assume is referring to the fact that the girls bathroom is on the other side of the library and this is the boys bathroom and whoever wrote it was probably on her period. Yikes. Good thing my flow just ended a few weeks ago so that\u2019s not a problem for me. At least\u2026 I hope it doesn\u2019t become a problem. I won\u2019t be here that long will I?\n\n\nNo no. I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll find a way out. I know I will. I\u2019m on floor 474 right now. Maybe 500 will be my lucky number? Only one way to find out. I\u2019ll look for more clues along the way since that was the only note she left on this floor.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n She wrote \u201c1/474 not enough tampons\u201d at the bottom of the page. Dr. Robert is laughing.\n\n\nEdit:\n It has been confirmed that a picture of the described message was found on the collected cellphone.\n\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m officially out of cash. I\u2019ve passed floor 500 if you were curious. Probably not because you\u2019re just a notebook. I\u2019ve never broken something before but I guess there\u2019s no real good time to begin a life a vandalism. I want that 3 musketeers really bad, and yes, I\u2019m totally willing to smash open a vending machine to get it. Whatever entity that\u2019s keeping me here can go and suck it. If it\u2019s going to withhold chocolate from me like this then I\u2019m going to have no qualms about breaking it\u2019s shit. Here goes nothing.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n At the bottom of the page she wrote the number 621.\n\n\n\n\nMy phone is dead. I\u2019m getting really tired so I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s night. I\u2019m currently on floor 730 so I guess I\u2019ll call it quits for the day. I just decided to fuck it and eat a bunch of candy bars for dinner, which in hindsight probably wasn\u2019t the best idea. Now I\u2019m cold, numb, and my throat feels like acid. None of the doors work but I\u2019ve been checking them at every floor. At least I hope I haven\u2019t forgotten one. Wouldn\u2019t that be a kicker? The one exit that actually works and I blanked past it. Probably not but it\u2019s a depressing thought.I haven\u2019t found anymore notes from that woman. I wonder if she\u2019s still stuck in here.\n\n\nAnyways. I should get to bed. I\u2019ve got another busy day of just\u2026 Walking up stairs. Forever.\n\n\nMaybe I should just jump and end it all lol. Well. Goodnight book.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n She doodled a bunch of snakes in the shape of the number 730.\n\n\n\n\nFloor number 800. Nothing.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nFloor number 900. Nothing.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nFloor number 1000. Nothing.\n\n\nWhat a surprise.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nFuck me. I smashed open another vending machine and cut my hand on a piece of glass. I\u2019m such a fucking stupid clutz. It hurts really bad and there aren\u2019t any medkits in the bathrooms. I just bandaged it up with some paper towels. Can I get an infection in here? So far there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything else alive besides me. Who knows. Who fucking cares.\n\n\nHurts like a fucking bitch though.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n No floor number was written on this page. But there are a few blood smears. This entry brings up an interesting experiment about microbial life within SCP-3964-1 to be explored later.\n\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of it sooner. I grabbed one of my pens and dropped it off the side of the railing. I know I said I was going to stay away from the edge but I had to watch it fall. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting really. The sound of impact probably but it never came. The pen just\u2026 Kept falling until it was just a speck and until I couldn\u2019t see it altogether. I wonder if it\u2019s still falling. I wonder if I would just keep falling forever if I jumped. It would probably be better than this endless wandering around that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\nI think the silence is getting to me.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n She wrote 1242 at the bottom of the page. The next dozen or so pages are just doodles and some short poems.\n\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t say how long I\u2019ve been in here. It feels like forever but it can\u2019t have been more than like 3 days. I\u2019m starting to feel tired again which means it must be night. Not that day cycles even exist in this hell hole. Maybe that\u2019s what it is. I died or something and I\u2019ve gone to hell. I\u2019m an atheist so that puts a real damper on things if that\u2019s true. Or maybe it\u2019s BECAUSE I\u2019m an atheist that I\u2019m stuck here. Damned here. Whatever.\n\n\nAnyways. Day 3 stuck in hell/purgatory over.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n A the bottom she wrote 1278. It is unclear whether a short amount of time had passed between the last entry and this one or if she had just stopped for a while to draw. I suspect the latter is true.\n\n\n\n\nToday I woke up and just laid there for hours.\n\n\nI tried to imagine I was just at home in the darkness but the hard tile floors make it a little hard to put myself into that fantasy. Also my house doesn\u2019t have air conditioning so there\u2019s that. At the very least, turning the bathroom lights off and closing the door makes me feel like I\u2019m blanketed in shadows. I just laid there in the dark, listening to my crying echo around the room. It\u2019s somewhat comforting.In the dark the walls around me don\u2019t have to exist. Or they can be as small as I want. I\u2019ve never been claustrophobic before but I wonder if I will be if I ever get out of here\u2026\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a steady ringing in my ear that I\u2019m not sure is real or not. I started noticing it a little yesterday but it\u2019s pretty apparent now. It\u2019s like a static noise, high pitched and almost inaudible. Like overtones in music. I\u2019m probably imagining it which doesn\u2019t really help me feel better at all.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I did eventually get up and keep walking. My little crying self-pity session helped me gain some energy back. I actually took to running a bunch of floors just to distract myself from thinking too much. It worked pretty well for a while until I stubbed my toe and tripped. I guess that\u2019s why they tell you not to run on stairs. I\u2019m lucky that I didn\u2019t tumble down them and break something. Because that would just take everything home wouldn\u2019t it? Being on an infinite staircase and being unable to walk?\n\n\n\nI think I\u2019ll just stick to my regular, snail-paced walking from now on.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n At the bottom here she doodled the number 1413 and next to it there is a drawing of a character with three buck teeth that Dr. Robert informs me is yet another Homestuck character.\n\n\n\n\nI think I see another note. There\u2019s something pinkish-red a dozen or so floors up. I know I said I wouldn\u2019t run again but I\u2019m going to break that rule just this once.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nIt is another note from the same girl. It\u2019s written on the water fountain right where I write my floor numbers (I wrote this one on the left door), still in that lipstick. It says \u201cI miss Duke\u201d.\n\n\nI wonder if it\u2019s her boyfriend? Or maybe it\u2019s her dog. Both?\n\n\nI get that though. I miss my little brother so much. This is my fourth day here (I think) so he must be worried sick about me. I hope someone picked him up from school when I didn\u2019t show up. I wonder if anyone\u2019s looking for me?\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n At the bottom here she wrote the number 1548.\n\n\nEdit:\n Looking into files of SCP-3964\u2019s past victims, one female of Latino descent has been found who had a son named Duke.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of day four. Floor 1600. A nice round number to stop on.\n\nI ate a bag of peanuts for breakfast.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know why I did it, because I hate peanuts. Maybe that initial feeling of disgust reminds me that I\u2019m still here. I exist. I\u2019m not crazy. It was something different for once.\n\n\nOr maybe I\u2019m just going crazy.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n She wrote the number 1674 at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\nWhat If There Is No Exit??\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n This is written in large letters taking up an entire two pages. Nothing else is written.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of day five. Floor 2000.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nI found her last note.\n\n\nIt\u2019s on floor 2112, not that these numbers even fucking mean anything.\n\n\nGod. I\u2019m so angry. Or sad. Both. Everything.\n\n\nMy phone is dead too and I just wish\u2026 I wish I could\u2019ve taken a picture of her last words. She wrote it on the bathroom mirror again. One word for each of the three mirrors:\n\n\nI\u2019m. Gonna. Jump.\n\n\nDid she make it out??? I mean if she did someone would\u2019ve heard about it right? Or they would just think she was crazy. Maybe she\u2019s still falling? Did she DIE?\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\n\nAll I know is that I\u2019m actually alone now.\n\n\nThis mysterious girl isn\u2019t just a bunch of floors above me. She didn\u2019t find an exit. She just\u2026 Gave up.\n\n\nMaybe I should too.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nEnd of day six. Floor 2400.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nI should jump. There clearly isn\u2019t an exit anywhere. I doubt there ever will be. I\u2019ve been walking for almost a week now and nothing. I didn\u2019t know isolation could be so harrowing. I keep on hearing that ringing. I keep imagining that someone is calling to me from a far away floor. I know I\u2019m just imagining it but I\u2019m actually going crazy in here. I\u2019ve had nothing to eat but the same dozen of snacks, nothing to sleep on but hard tiles, and nothing to drink besides that disgusting tasting fountain water. I\u2019m sick of it all.\n\n\nIf I don\u2019t find an exit in the next 50 floors I\u2019m going to jump.\n\n\nIf this is existence then I don\u2019t want to exist anymore.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2026\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n The number 2600 is written on the bottom.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m ten floors away from 50. And I\u2026 Gods. I haven\u2019t even told my best friend about this yet. Maybe this is karma. This is some cruel deity granting my wish. Be careful what you wish for right? Well anyways\u2026\n\n\nI\u2019ve been planning my suicide.\n\n\nI doubt that I would\u2019ve gone through with is. Dad is still relying on me. Charlie is still relying on me. If I just left they would be devastated. Charlie would probably kill himself if I did it first. He\u2019s not strong enough to live. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think I would go through with it but like\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m being punished? I didn\u2019t value my life enough so now I HAVE TO kill myself. It\u2019s tempting I\u2019m not going to lie.\n\n\nBut\u2026\n\n\nI know that new Star Wars movie was coming out. I really wanted to see how the trilogy ended. Game of thrones\u2019 final season isn\u2019t out yet. I haven\u2019t seen infinity war either. Or the next Spider Man homecoming movie. Or black panther. Lily is graduating in a year too. And Sarah and I haven\u2019t gone to Europe yet like we wanted to.\n\n\nI\u2019m actually kinda scared to take the next ten floors.\n\n\nDoes this mean that I don\u2019t actually want to die?\n\n\nLife is so hard. Between Charlie\u2019s depression. Mom and Dad\u2019s divorce. The constant fear of Charlie trying to off himself\u2026\n\n\nWell. I guess I\u2019ll find out in ten floors.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m here. Floor 1650. I should\u2019ve waited for a nice 413 reference to off myself to. That would be real poetic. Herein lies \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a homestuck even in death. But that\u2019s a lot more floors to go. I guess I could walk back down to 1413 but that\u2019s still like a bunch of floors. I already decided on this floor anyways.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A.\n\n\n\n\nOk. I\u2019ve been sitting here for like an hour. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t do it. I want to see Charlie again. I want to see Sarah again. I want to hold my dog again. God I miss my dog.\n\n\nI want to live.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n N/A\n\n\n\n\nSo shouting \u201cI want to live\u201d clearly is not the way to do this. I guess jumping is the only real option. But I really really don\u2019t want to die. And I\u2019m terrified of heights. Why did I think suicide via falling was such a good idea in the first place?\n\n\nBesides the point.\n\n\nOk.

        "Addendum.1: The first record of anomalous behavior is traced to [DATA EXPUNGED] after the opening of the campus. It is unknown whether this incident was the cause of or a consequence of SCP-3964. The civilian student involved had jumped to his death from the top of the stairwell. The cause of death was severe head trauma, consistent with a fall of 25 meters 2 . Investigation revealed a history of depression.\nSimilar cases followed for \u2588\u2588 years after the initial incident. Witnesses describe the suicides as \u201cspontaneous\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d, but the Foundation had no evidence to suspect that this might be a site of an anomaly. After several years, SCP-3964 was being referred to as the \"Suicide Staircase\" by the student body.\nSCP-3964 first came to the attention of the Foundation following Incident-3964-1. A caucasian woman (designated SCP-3964-2-A) was observed to have used SCP-3964 to walk from the first floor to the second landing where she then jumped and landed unharmed on the floor below. In attempts to describe the experience to others a field agent assigned to the area learned of the SCP-3964-2-A's experience within SCP-3964-1 and notified the Foundation. SCP-3964-2-A was then detained, debriefed, and given a Class-C amnestic before release. A notebook recording her experiences of her time in SCP-3964-1 was collected for study along with her cellphone and other belonging. Afterwards, the Foundation bricked off SCP-3964 and built Site-\u2588\u2588-B.\n"

        "I don\u2019t know where I am. I mean\u2026 This shouldn\u2019t be possible right? I was only trying to get to the second floor of the library and now I\u2019m stuck in some endless loop of stairs. It\u2019s been about an hour that I\u2019ve been walking around and nothing. It\u2019s just endless floor after floor. When I lean over the edge it just seems to stretch on forever and ever in both directions and I get this weird pull in my gut. You know, that weird feeling you get standing super close to the edge that just kinda whispers \u201cjump\u201d? It\u2019s unnerving so I\u2019m going to stay away from the edge from now on. I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ve tried the doors on either side of each floor but they\u2019re all locked. This is scary. Which is why I guess I\u2019m writing in you. There\u2019s no reception in here either. There\u2019s nothing here except the thoughts in my head. I keep thinking I\u2019m going to run into someone, that I\u2019ll hear someone. Sometimes I think I do hear something but it\u2019s just silent. But like a loud silence ya know? Heavy and stuff. It doesn\u2019t help that it feels air conditioned in here despite the fact that I haven\u2019t seen a single vent or air conditioner. I tried shouting but my voice just echoes on until it fades away. That\u2019s a little spooky so I don't think I\u2019ll try it again. Besides, what would I even do if someone answered? Something? I don\u2019t even want to think about it. This place doesn\u2019t feel natural, it obviously isn\u2019t, so I don\u2019t want to push my luck. I also think I\u2019m going to start counting floors. Idk how many floors I\u2019ve already walked down so I\u2019m just going to count this as number 1 and go from there. I\u2019ll start heading up again since going down doesn\u2019t seem to be working.",
        "I\u2019m on floor 206, it\u2019s been 6 hours, and my phone battery is going to die soon but I\u2019m dying of boredom. I decided to just fuck it and play a few games but that drained my battery a lot. I probably shouldn\u2019t have done that because I just realized there aren\u2019t any clocks in here and my phone is my only source of telling time. And even though counting the floors and hours is making me crazy I think it\u2019ll be even worse without knowing the time. I\u2019m so fucking stupid. I\u2019m just going to leave it on low battery mode and hope for the best. I doubt it\u2019ll survive another 6 hours though. I\u2019m also super exhausted. It\u2019s about 8\u00a0o\u2019clock now and I got up at like 4 and all this walking is tiring. Maybe whatever trapped me in here is trying to make me exercise? Well. Whatever it is I don\u2019t really want to go to sleep. And there isn\u2019t even anything suitable to sleep on. I guess I could collect a bunch of paper towels from each floor and make a bed? But what if something creeps up on me while I\u2019m sleeping? I doubt I could sleep anyways. I guess\u2026 I\u2019ll just keep walking until I pass out from exhaustion. There\u2019s nothing better to do.",
        "I think I\u2019m going to die in here. I finally gave up last night and slept in one of the bathrooms, which was the only place I could turn off the damn lights. I did collect a bunch of paper towels and made a bed and used my jacket and backpack as well. It\u2019s about 3 in the morning now and I can\u2019t sleep anymore. I still feel exhausted but my mind won\u2019t let me rest. I\u2019m also starving. I just realized that I didn\u2019t eat last night. I guess the good thing is that nothing has attacked me yet which either means there\u2019s nothing but me in here or whatever is out there is trying to lull me into a sense of comfort. I\u2019m honestly not sure which I would prefer at this point. I just wish if there really is some monster it\u2019ll just get it over with an kill me now. All this waiting is unbearable. There\u2019s a vending machine on every floor, all with the same snacks (there are some tuna salad sandwiches so that\u2019s good), but I don\u2019t have that much cash on me. If I don\u2019t get out of here today I\u2019ll just have to smash them open with something. There are a few fire extinguishers around so I\u2019ll probably just use one of those or something. At least there\u2019s water fountains so I don\u2019t dehydrate but apparently even in weird limbo spaces water fountains are still disgusting as hell.",
        "This is floor 413\u2026 I think. I\u2019m starting to lose track. The silence and the cold air is numbing my mind. I might\u2019ve skipped counting a few floors or lost count somewhere. I can\u2019t be sure. I have a sharpie so I think I\u2019ll start writing the floor numbers on the water fountains because it\u2019s a shiny eye catching place. Maybe I should leave little messages if anyone else gets stuck here? I hope no one else gets stuck in here but I mean\u2026 I might as well right? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got anything better to do.",
        "SOMEONE ELSE WAS HERE. They left a note! It\u2019s written in lipstick on the mirror in the bathroom which is a little disconcerting but it means I\u2019m not the only one! I took a picture of it on my phone, which is now at 3%, but I think it was still a worthy use of the battery life. I wish I remembered to bring my charger this morning. It occurred to me while I was eating breakfast that the vending machines use outlets. But I don\u2019t have my charger anyways so the point is moot. Anyways, the note reads \u201cFuck this sexist place. No tampons.\u201d Which I assume is referring to the fact that the girls bathroom is on the other side of the library and this is the boys bathroom and whoever wrote it was probably on her period. Yikes. Good thing my flow just ended a few weeks ago so that\u2019s not a problem for me. At least\u2026 I hope it doesn\u2019t become a problem. I won\u2019t be here that long will I? No no. I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll find a way out. I know I will. I\u2019m on floor 474 right now. Maybe 500 will be my lucky number? Only one way to find out. I\u2019ll look for more clues along the way since that was the only note she left on this floor.",
        "So I\u2019m officially out of cash. I\u2019ve passed floor 500 if you were curious. Probably not because you\u2019re just a notebook. I\u2019ve never broken something before but I guess there\u2019s no real good time to begin a life a vandalism. I want that 3 musketeers really bad, and yes, I\u2019m totally willing to smash open a vending machine to get it. Whatever entity that\u2019s keeping me here can go and suck it. If it\u2019s going to withhold chocolate from me like this then I\u2019m going to have no qualms about breaking it\u2019s shit. Here goes nothing.",
        "My phone is dead. I\u2019m getting really tired so I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s night. I\u2019m currently on floor 730 so I guess I\u2019ll call it quits for the day. I just decided to fuck it and eat a bunch of candy bars for dinner, which in hindsight probably wasn\u2019t the best idea. Now I\u2019m cold, numb, and my throat feels like acid. None of the doors work but I\u2019ve been checking them at every floor. At least I hope I haven\u2019t forgotten one. Wouldn\u2019t that be a kicker? The one exit that actually works and I blanked past it. Probably not but it\u2019s a depressing thought.I haven\u2019t found anymore notes from that woman. I wonder if she\u2019s still stuck in here. Anyways. I should get to bed. I\u2019ve got another busy day of just\u2026 Walking up stairs. Forever. Maybe I should just jump and end it all lol. Well. Goodnight book.",
        "Floor number 800. Nothing.",
        "Floor number 900. Nothing.",
        "Floor number 1000. Nothing. What a surprise.",
        "Fuck me. I smashed open another vending machine and cut my hand on a piece of glass. I\u2019m such a fucking stupid clutz. It hurts really bad and there aren\u2019t any medkits in the bathrooms. I just bandaged it up with some paper towels. Can I get an infection in here? So far there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything else alive besides me. Who knows. Who fucking cares. Hurts like a fucking bitch though.",
        "I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of it sooner. I grabbed one of my pens and dropped it off the side of the railing. I know I said I was going to stay away from the edge but I had to watch it fall. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting really. The sound of impact probably but it never came. The pen just\u2026 Kept falling until it was just a speck and until I couldn\u2019t see it altogether. I wonder if it\u2019s still falling. I wonder if I would just keep falling forever if I jumped. It would probably be better than this endless wandering around that\u2019s for sure. I think the silence is getting to me.",
        "I can\u2019t say how long I\u2019ve been in here. It feels like forever but it can\u2019t have been more than like 3 days. I\u2019m starting to feel tired again which means it must be night. Not that day cycles even exist in this hell hole. Maybe that\u2019s what it is. I died or something and I\u2019ve gone to hell. I\u2019m an atheist so that puts a real damper on things if that\u2019s true. Or maybe it\u2019s BECAUSE I\u2019m an atheist that I\u2019m stuck here. Damned here. Whatever. Anyways. Day 3 stuck in hell/purgatory over.",
        "Today I woke up and just laid there for hours. I tried to imagine I was just at home in the darkness but the hard tile floors make it a little hard to put myself into that fantasy. Also my house doesn\u2019t have air conditioning so there\u2019s that. At the very least, turning the bathroom lights off and closing the door makes me feel like I\u2019m blanketed in shadows. I just laid there in the dark, listening to my crying echo around the room. It\u2019s somewhat comforting.In the dark the walls around me don\u2019t have to exist. Or they can be as small as I want. I\u2019ve never been claustrophobic before but I wonder if I will be if I ever get out of here\u2026 There\u2019s a steady ringing in my ear that I\u2019m not sure is real or not. I started noticing it a little yesterday but it\u2019s pretty apparent now. It\u2019s like a static noise, high pitched and almost inaudible. Like overtones in music. I\u2019m probably imagining it which doesn\u2019t really help me feel better at all. Anyways, I did eventually get up and keep walking. My little crying self-pity session helped me gain some energy back. I actually took to running a bunch of floors just to distract myself from thinking too much. It worked pretty well for a while until I stubbed my toe and tripped. I guess that\u2019s why they tell you not to run on stairs. I\u2019m lucky that I didn\u2019t tumble down them and break something. Because that would just take everything home wouldn\u2019t it? Being on an infinite staircase and being unable to walk? I think I\u2019ll just stick to my regular, snail-paced walking from now on.",
        "I think I see another note. There\u2019s something pinkish-red a dozen or so floors up. I know I said I wouldn\u2019t run again but I\u2019m going to break that rule just this once.",
        "It is another note from the same girl. It\u2019s written on the water fountain right where I write my floor numbers (I wrote this one on the left door), still in that lipstick. It says \u201cI miss Duke\u201d. I wonder if it\u2019s her boyfriend? Or maybe it\u2019s her dog. Both? I get that though. I miss my little brother so much. This is my fourth day here (I think) so he must be worried sick about me. I hope someone picked him up from school when I didn\u2019t show up. I wonder if anyone\u2019s looking for me?",
        "End of day four. Floor 1600. A nice round number to stop on. I ate a bag of peanuts for breakfast. I don\u2019t know why I did it, because I hate peanuts. Maybe that initial feeling of disgust reminds me that I\u2019m still here. I exist. I\u2019m not crazy. It was something different for once. Or maybe I\u2019m just going crazy.",
        "What If There Is No Exit??",
        "End of day five. Floor 2000.",
        "I found her last note. It\u2019s on floor 2112, not that these numbers even fucking mean anything. God. I\u2019m so angry. Or sad. Both. Everything. My phone is dead too and I just wish\u2026 I wish I could\u2019ve taken a picture of her last words. She wrote it on the bathroom mirror again. One word for each of the three mirrors: I\u2019m. Gonna. Jump. Did she make it out??? I mean if she did someone would\u2019ve heard about it right? Or they would just think she was crazy. Maybe she\u2019s still falling? Did she DIE? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I want to know. All I know is that I\u2019m actually alone now. This mysterious girl isn\u2019t just a bunch of floors above me. She didn\u2019t find an exit. She just\u2026 Gave up. Maybe I should too.",
        "End of day six. Floor 2400.",
        "I should jump. There clearly isn\u2019t an exit anywhere. I doubt there ever will be. I\u2019ve been walking for almost a week now and nothing. I didn\u2019t know isolation could be so harrowing. I keep on hearing that ringing. I keep imagining that someone is calling to me from a far away floor. I know I\u2019m just imagining it but I\u2019m actually going crazy in here. I\u2019ve had nothing to eat but the same dozen of snacks, nothing to sleep on but hard tiles, and nothing to drink besides that disgusting tasting fountain water. I\u2019m sick of it all. If I don\u2019t find an exit in the next 50 floors I\u2019m going to jump. If this is existence then I don\u2019t want to exist anymore. I\u2019m sorry\u2026",
        "I\u2019m ten floors away from 50. And I\u2026 Gods. I haven\u2019t even told my best friend about this yet. Maybe this is karma. This is some cruel deity granting my wish. Be careful what you wish for right? Well anyways\u2026 I\u2019ve been planning my suicide. I doubt that I would\u2019ve gone through with is. Dad is still relying on me. Charlie is still relying on me. If I just left they would be devastated. Charlie would probably kill himself if I did it first. He\u2019s not strong enough to live. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think I would go through with it but like\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m being punished? I didn\u2019t value my life enough so now I HAVE TO kill myself. It\u2019s tempting I\u2019m not going to lie. But\u2026 I know that new Star Wars movie was coming out. I really wanted to see how the trilogy ended. Game of thrones\u2019 final season isn\u2019t out yet. I haven\u2019t seen infinity war either. Or the next Spider Man homecoming movie. Or black panther. Lily is graduating in a year too. And Sarah and I haven\u2019t gone to Europe yet like we wanted to. I\u2019m actually kinda scared to take the next ten floors. Does this mean that I don\u2019t actually want to die? Life is so hard. Between Charlie\u2019s depression. Mom and Dad\u2019s divorce. The constant fear of Charlie trying to off himself\u2026 Well. I guess I\u2019ll find out in ten floors.",
        "I\u2019m here. Floor 1650. I should\u2019ve waited for a nice 413 reference to off myself to. That would be real poetic. Herein lies \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a homestuck even in death. But that\u2019s a lot more floors to go. I guess I could walk back down to 1413 but that\u2019s still like a bunch of floors. I already decided on this floor anyways.",
        "Ok. I\u2019ve been sitting here for like an hour. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t do it. I want to see Charlie again. I want to see Sarah again. I want to hold my dog again. God I miss my dog. I want to live.",
        "So shouting \u201cI want to live\u201d clearly is not the way to do this. I guess jumping is the only real option. But I really really don\u2019t want to die. And I\u2019m terrified of heights. Why did I think suicide via falling was such a good idea in the first place? Besides the point. Ok. I\u2019ve decided. I\u2019m going to jump. But I\u2019m going to pray like hell that I don\u2019t die. So whatever deity is out there or responsible for trapping me in here\u2026 I promise that I want to live. So please PLEASE let me survive this. Once I\u2019ve\u2026 ya know actually worked up the courage to jump of course. Not like there\u2019s anything better for me to do anyways.",
