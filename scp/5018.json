This terminal is physically secured with non-electronic locks and is to remain unpowered outside of authorized testing. Site 15 AI THEIA is to monitor all Foundation networks for suspicious activity fitting SCP-5018's electronic pattern. If discovered, MTF Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") and MTF Rho-9 (\"Technical Support\") are to be deployed immediately to isolate and purge all instances of SCP-5018.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-5018 is an advanced self-replicating malware capable of releasing reinforced magnetic containment locks\n1\n connected to the Foundation network. Analysis of the MCL's indicates that their magnetic field had been disrupted\n2\n, causing a subsequent repulsion to occur. How SCP-5018 exhibits this ability, and the entity which created the program is still under investigation.\n3\n\n\nSCP-5018's execution command initiates once it confirms the presence of specific parameters in the affected system. The execution of the code triggers the manifestation of SCP-5018-1 within 5 meters of the terminal.\n\n\nSCP-5018-1 is an indistinct humanoid figure that can only be observed through digitized media and de-manifests when SCP-5018's running code is terminated. Although all attempts at verbal communication with SCP-5018-1 have been unsuccessful, it has been observed to acknowledge others around it through the use of exaggerated body language.\n4\n\n\nSCP-5018 was discovered on 9/15/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on the Foundation's network. Probes scanning for its digital signature detected that the malware was spread over 74% of the Foundation network. Of the detected instances, only approximately 10% of them had been executed, with 8% activating in high-security level sites. How SCP-5018 gained access into the Foundation network is under investigation. MTF Rho-9 has been tasked with its removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 5018-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Report ID #: 5018-A1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n On 07/19/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Site 119 initiated a 119/B/Coldsilver \nLockdown Response Code\n following containment breaches of six Large Scale Aggressors, four Non-Terminable Threats, and five other extradimensional anomalous threats. O4 approved the detonation of Site 119's nuclear warhead one hour and thirty-four minutes after the Lockdown Response Code was initiated. Site 68 received a backup of files, sent by Director David Bold, 26 minutes after the destruction of Site 119. Included in the backup was one folder of encrypted files and one image taken after the detonation. Following the incident, MTF Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") was dispatched to establish a perimeter around the affected area.\n\n\n\nMTF \u03b5-11 was unable to locate any threats after Site 119's detonation. However, MTF \u03b5-11 reported sightings of 5 unidentified individuals 3 days following Site 119's destruction. MTF \u03b5-11's attempt to apprehend the individuals were unsuccessful\n5\n. MTF \u03b5-11 was immediately relieved by MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") and sent to Site 68 for medical treatment and debriefing. 6 weeks after the detonation, MTF Omicron-2 (\"Nuclear Nomads\") was sent to investigate the remains of Site 119.\n\n\n\n\nMTF o-2 discovered 15 compromised MCLs in the remains of Site 119. This incident is recorded as the first insertion point of SCP-5018 into the Foundation's network infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess\u00a0Attached\u00a0Image:\u00a0SCP-5018-1\n\n\n\n\nClose\u00a0Attached\u00a0Image:\u00a0SCP-5018-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metadata of the original image was 6% corrupted once it was retrieved.

Replication continued as a background task for 30 minutes until SCP-5018's code self-terminated. 20 replicates were later discovered in a hidden file.\n6\n The terminal was powered off to prevent the spread of these replicates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Number\n : 5018-B\n\n\n\n\nProtocol:\n SCP-5018 runs on a standard computer terminal connected to a MCL.\n7\n\n\n\n\nResults:\n SCP-5018-1 manifests within the chamber, and is detected by camera feed of the chamber. Researchers within the chamber cannot observe SCP-5018-1, however, SCP-5018-1 acknowledges their presence by shaking its fists at them, then begins to hover over the MCL.\n\n\n\n\nAfter 1 minute, SCP-5018-1 de-manifests and the MCL is opened. Results are similar to the MCLs in Site 119.

An investigation of Researcher Argosts experimentation revealed that he was in possession of an encrypted file.

Noticed some unusual things about them. For starters, I think the metadata in the Image Analysis is broken. I can't exactly figure out why, but some of the information can be seen through the censors. Guess our guys in the back kind of failed at their jobs. I'm going to try investigating more.\n\n\n\n\nFigured it out. I just had to hover around sections of the censored parts to reveal some text. Could only find one thing. How did this get here? Surely, our guys weren't slacking, right? Well damn. I guess I'll keep snooping around then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Access Note 2\n- Close Note 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, so I found something else.

        "I was checking over some of SCP-5018's metadata and code today. Noticed some unusual things about them. For starters, I think the metadata in the Image Analysis is broken. I can't exactly figure out why, but some of the information can be seen through the censors. Guess our guys in the back kind of failed at their jobs. I'm going to try investigating more. Figured it out. I just had to hover around sections of the censored parts to reveal some text. Could only find one thing. How did this get here? Surely, our guys weren't slacking, right? Well damn. I guess I'll keep snooping around then.",

        "That last one's pretty easy. It's basically written down. How we all missed that, I'll never understand. I guess, since we weren't actively looking for something resembling a password, we overlooked it. Oh well, I should have all the phrases by now. All I have to do now is type the three words out, hopefully, in the order they're presented (hopefully there are no spaces in between). But, I can't stop asking myself, \"why?\" What's the game, here? Whatever this is that I'm accessing better tell me something fucking important, or I'm dropping the hammer on this thing.",
