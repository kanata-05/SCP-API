Interaction with SCP-2749 must only be done through the use of remote control, as this method has proved acceptable to circumvent the items' anomalous effects. No further containment procedures are necessary at this time.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2749 is a 120cm long black and red cotton tie. If SCP-2749 comes into physical contact with any inanimate object with a mass less than 10kg, a tie identical to SCP-2749 will appear wrapped around that object. Removal of this secondary tie will result in a negation of SCP-2749's effects. Objects affected by SCP-2749 are designated SCP-2749-A.\n1\n\n\nOnce affected, SCP-2749-A will display sapience with high levels of intelligence.\n\nSCP-2749-A instances react to visual and auditory stimuli through unknown means. Additionally, instances are capable of independent locomotion.\n\n\nThe way SCP-2749-A instances communicate is dependant on the object affected. English is the primary language used by SCP-2749-A instances. Topics of conversation appear to be limited to an unknown organisation identified as 'Business Incorporated.'\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Experiment-2749-A\u00a0(2016/06/02)\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\n\n\n\n\nDuring experiment-2749-A (2016/06/02), all instances of SCP-2749-A were placed in a single testing chamber. Instances included:\n\n\n\n\n1 pencil (affected)\n\n\n4 chairs (affected)\n\n\n2 small tables (affected)\n\n\n20 disposable plastic cups (affected)\n\n\n1 stapler (affected)\n\n\n1 children's bicycle (affected)\n\n\n1 laptop (affected)\n\n\n1 printer (affected)\n\n\n50 A4 sheets of paper (unaffected)\n\n\n2 large tables (unaffected)\n\n\n5 ink cartridges (unaffected)\n\n\n2\u00a02x5m plywood walls (unaffected)\n\n\n1 coffee machine (unaffected)\n\n\n3 A1 sheets of paper (unaffected)\n\n\n\n\nSCP-2749-A instances immediately constructed a crude conference room using the materials provided. This included a logo displaying:\n\n\n\n\nWELCOME TO THE BUSINESS INC. METAL BOX BRANCH!\n\n\nIt's \neveryone's\n business!\n\nIf you have any requests to make, please go to the reception area!\n\n\n\n\nThe following was recorded via CCTV.\n\n\n\n\n9:00am 2016/06/04\n\n\n(Several instances of SCP-2749-A are seen gathered on the large table communicating with a series of taps which were translated from Morse code.)\n\n\nSCP-2749-A1 (pencil):\n Hello everyone, it's nice to see you all at today's business meeting. Today I'd like everyone to express their thoughts on Mr. Tables's new business plan!\n\n\nSCP-2749-A5 (table 1):\n Thank you, pencil. Before we start, would anyone like refreshments?\n\n\n(7 instances of SCP-2749-A9 (plastic cups) use the coffee machine to fill themselves with coffee. They then approach several different instances of SCP-2749-A, which quickly move into them, spilling the coffee.)\n\n\nSCP-2749-A3 (laptop):\n Mmm\u2026 That was refreshing.\n\n\nSCP-2749-A8 (printer):\n Table was thinking about our success rate, and made this graph to show you all how it's at a steady decline.\n\n\n(SCP-2749-A8 prints a line graph displaying the \"business ratio\" from 2000-2016.)\n\n\nSCP-2749-A2 (chair 1):\n Unbelievable! I thought it was rising at this juncture!\n\n\nSCP-2749-A1:\n If that acluistic boomerang hadn't changed the structure we wouldn't be in this mess! He should have known this was risky business.\n\n\nSCP-2749-A4 (stapler):\n Honest to God, this should have been our highpoint, not our downfall!\n\n\nSCP-2749-A5:\n And that is why I'm here. You see our bike friend over there? He's in contact with a business management team that claim they can deliver business stocks twice as quick and twice as cheap! I think we can call it: \"Business Inc.'s Fast Business\" I'm aiming for efficiency improvements across the piece.\n\n\nSCP-2749-A6 (bike):\n All he has said is true.
