It will then appear to scan the nearby area by craning its neck while seemingly becoming increasingly distressed; during this period of animation, it will emit several low vocalizations before becoming inanimate again at 6:31.\n\n\nSCP-3708 produces a mild euphoric response in individuals that physically contact it; affected subjects report feelings of warmth and comfort.\n\n\nSCP-3708 was recovered from the residence of the recently deceased Reinier Costede, an 83-year-old farmer, in Gilman, Wisconsin. Following the witnessing of SCP-3708's anomalous properties by Costede's relatives, field agents responded to reports of a \"living chicken statue\" circulating in the small village. Costede's residence was searched, and SCP-3708 was recovered without incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3708.1:\n \nRecovered Document\n\n\nUpon the recovery of SCP-3708, a small note was found taped to the side of its body.\n\n\n\n\nPa,\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to be gone for a while.\n\nMaybe I won't return.\n\nI know you don't get many visitors out here\u2026\n\n\nI found you something to keep you company, though!\n\nA little reminder of me, I guess. His name's Benny.\n\nTake good care of him, OK?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarguerit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 3708.2:\n \nRecovered Document\n\n\nIn addition to SCP-3708, a journal was found in Costede's residence; irrelevant content has been excluded.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 23rd, 2016\n\n\nMarguerit left in the afternoon, and gave me this little sculpture. It reminds me of a rooster I used to have as a child. I've put him on top of my nightstand for now.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 24th, 2016\n\n\nToday I woke up to the sound of a rooster calling, but I haven't had any on this farm in over 60 years now. For a second, I'd thought it was Marguerit calling me down. Must've been little Benny trying to keep me company. It's better than waking up alone.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 25th, 2016\n\n\nI woke up a little earlier today, and while doing my morning routine I heard Benny crowing again. I went over to where I had placed him, and by God, he was moving! I reached my hand out to touch him and he rubbed up against it. Then, he went back to normal\u2026 I don't know if I'm getting enough sleep.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 26th, 2016\n\n\nI thought it was the sleep, but it happened again today. This time, it looked like he was waiting for me. I pet him again and he soon went still. Reminded me of when Marguerit was just a baby\u2026 she'd always wake up crying in the middle of the night, and wouldn't quiet down until I went over to comfort her.\n\n\n\n\nNovember 19th, 2016\n\n\nSaying good-morning to Benny is part of my routine now. I think he's used to having me around, and so am I. She was right about me needing company. I only wish I could have him around more often than a minute each morning. Then again, it does make our time together more treasured. I didn't have Marguerit around for very long, either.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 21st, 2016\n\n\nBenny seemed more active than usual today. He was practically flailing about, crowing his head off about God-knows-what. Normally I'd be annoyed, but\u2026 with him, it's hard to. I was half-hoping that Marguerit had returned and he was crowing at that, but that wasn't the case. I just wish someone would come.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 22nd, 2016\n\n\nHe kept it up today, which was no surprise. I just comforted him until he calmed down. Then, back to stone. God, why does he have to turn back to stone?\n\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\nI came down with something, by the looks of it. I've been with a nasty cough for the better half of this afternoon. It's bearable, though. At least I have something to look forward to in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 23rd, 2016\n \n(final entry)\n\n\nIt looks like the flu. I think Benny knows, too. He seemed worried when I went to say good-morning today. But I'll be okay, for him. For Marguerit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3707\n | SCP-3708 | \nSCP-3709\n \u00bb",
