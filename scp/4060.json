Personnel assigned to the SCP-4060 must undergo psychological evaluations and debriefings every month and after each onsite containment breach.\n\n\nAny onsite personnel shown to have sympathies towards any groups of interest on the Notable Groups of Interest List should be reported to Site Director Dr. Matthews.\n\n\n\n\nRequest\u00a0Notable\u00a0Groups\u00a0of\u00a0Interest\u00a0List\n\n\n\n\nReplace\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Groups of Interest List\n\n\n\n\nThis list is not comprehensive, if you are worried about the possible affiliations of a coworker please bring it up to Site Director Dr. Matthews.\n\n\n\n\nThe Church of the Broken God\n\n\nThe Fifth Church\n\n\nThe Global Occult Coalition (GOC)\n\n\nThe Horizon Initiative\n\n\nMarshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\n\n\n\"Nobody\"\n\n\nOffice For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (ORIA)\n\n\nSarkic Cults\n\n\nThe Serpent's Hand\n\n\nUnusual Incidents Unit (UIU), Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4060 is a small black two-pan beam balance scale. SCP-4060 is able to exchange memories between an individual and itself. Furthermore, SCP-4060 is known to obtain and store any memory that has been lost due to an amnestic, as well as any the object acquires through an exchange.\n\n\nSCP-4060's exchange manifests after a subject knowingly places at least one object on both sides of the scale and once both sides of the scale are left undisturbed for approximately 30 seconds.\n\n\nDuring the exchange, the objects on the right side of the scale are the influencing parameters for the memories the subject will lose. The same factors on the left side of the scale similarly influence the memories the subject will acquire.\n\n\nIt is currently unknown how SCP-4060 chooses what memories are exchanged within a given set of influencing parameters. The following are the current hypothetical effects of the influencing parameters for the exchanges caused by SCP-4060:\n\n\n\n\nThe total mass on a side of the scale correlates to the length of the memory exchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total quantity of objects on a side of the scale correlates to the age of the memories SCP-4060 can exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a subject places an object on the scale, that subjects sentimental or perceived value of the object correlates to the subjective importance/weight of memories exchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould an object that a subject places onto the scale have any strong personally held connotations for that subject, it will cause some of the exchanged memories content to correlate to that connotation.\n\n\n\n\nRecovery:\n SCP-4060 was recovered on 07/15/2005 by Mobile Task Force Delta-5 from Area \u2588\u2588, Sector \u2588\u2588, after \u2588\u2588 simultaneous containment breaches had compromised the functionality of the facility. Only a single handwritten letter regarding SCP-4060 was found in the remains of Sector \u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\nRequest\u00a0Letter\u00a0Recovered\u00a0from\u00a0Area\u00a0\u2588\u2588,\u00a0Sector\u00a0\u2588\u2588,\u00a007/15/2005\n\n\n\n\nReturn\u00a0Letter\n\n\n\n\nLetter Recovered from Area \u2588\u2588, Sector \u2588\u2588, 07/15/2005\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\nI am recording this as my last act on this earth.\n\n\nAgents of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 have infiltrated us and caused the simultaneous containment breaches that I am sure are causing a horrible diversion right now.\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who had been showing more and more overt sympathy towards \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, had been found to have leaked that SCP-4060 had granted memories related to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in a previous test.\n\n\nI am afraid\n I am sure that he was radicalized by agents of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. They are most likely on their way here. After all, I have the only key to SCP-4060's storage container.\n\n\nThat is why I am going to destroy our records of SCP-4060 and march into the other room. Then I will activate the Pyrogallol fire suppression system, take a Class D Amnestic to pass out, and ruin any hope those \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 zealots have of getting to the key alive.\n\n\nBy the time anyone will manage to break into SCP-4060's container, it will be well after Recovery Agents arrive.\n\n\nI know they won't let you see this, but I need to say it. Even if I can't force myself to say it out loud. Marie I\n\n\nI am a member of the Foundation.\n\n\nI\n \nWe\n Secure. \nWe\n Contain. \nWe\n Protect.\n\n\nThat is our mission.\n\n\nI love you Marie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/15/2008 - Notice from Site Director Dr. Matthews:\n It is also worth reiterating that any memory ever lost via an amnestic, by any individual, SCP-4060 has stored within it. Thus, a subject that uses SCP-4060 can acquire any such memory. As acquired memories are unaffected by amnestics, in order to prevent memory of catastrophic sensitivity being acquired by unauthorized personnel, only Class D personnel are permitted to interact with SCP-4060 and thereafter must have all of their communication closely monitored for one month by a team with at least Level 3 clearance.\n\n\nInitial Testing:\n Test Log only accessible to personnel with clearance Level 4 or higher.\n\n\n\nInput\u00a0Credentials\n\n\n\n\nReturn\u00a0Log\n\n\n\n\nTest 11/15/2005\n\n\n\n\nTest Overseen by Researcher Dr. Matthews.\n\n\nSubjects:\n D-1753, male, age twenty-two.\n\n\nProcedure:\n Subject D-1753 places seven 1 gram weights on the left side of the scale and then three 1 gram weight on the right side of the scale.\n\n\nResults:\n Subject D-1753 exclaimed the name of his girlfriend, who he claims had not visited him while he was incarcerated three years ago.

Subject later found to have lost all memory how to solve a Rubik's cube.\n\n\nAnalysis:\n Memories which are gained are unaffected by amnestics.
