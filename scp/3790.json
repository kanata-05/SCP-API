The only access to this space is down a narrow stairwell that ends in a short black door. The door is free of identifying markings save for a small metal placard just above the door handle that reads \"SCP Foundation Department of Abnormalities\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remainder of this file has been locked by O5 order.\nLock Overridden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interior of SCP-3790 consists of several descending levels, each consisting of a hallway containing four doors, two per side, and a grated freight elevator at the far end of the corridor leading to the lower levels. While there is evidence of prior human activity within SCP-3790, the structure appears to have been abandoned for a considerable amount of time.\n\n\nEach of the doors is a solid, heavy metal door with a sliding panel covering a small glass viewport into the dimly lit chamber beyond. The doors, some of which are rusted but otherwise undamaged, have at some point in the past had their handles and unlocking mechanisms removed, and have been welded shut. The only distinguishing marks on these doors are small metal placards located just beneath the sliding panel. These placards usually bear what is believed to be the designation for the contents of the chamber, though in some cases the placards have been removed or are damaged.\n\n\nA clipboard holding a legal pad hangs on the back of the main access door. Several pages appear to have been torn away from the pad. The frontmost intact piece of paper contains a list of names and a short note. The remainder of the pages are irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Show Clipboard Text\n- Hide Clipboard Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink it's about time.

No information regarding the structure has been documented.\n\n\nAddendum 3790.1:\n Chamber Contents\n\n\nThe following is a list of the rooms on each floor, the text on each door's placard, and a visual description of the contents of each chamber, if possible.\n\n\n\n\nLevel One\n\n\n\n\nRoom One\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Vivaldi\n\n\nDescription:\n Chamber is empty aside from a violin propped in the far corner of the room. The bow is broken on the ground in front of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Two\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Montezuma's Face\n\n\nDescription:\n An ornate wooden chest with gold inlays and a large steel lock sits on a table in the middle of the chamber. A quiet clicking sound, like that of a clock, is barely audible from within the chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Three\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n \nNo placard\n\n\nDescription:\n Chamber is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Four\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n \nPlacard has been damaged and text is unreadable\n\n\nDescription:\n Chamber is empty. Long gashes cover the walls. Pieces of bone are visible across the chamber floor.\n\n\n\n\nLevel Two\n\n\n\n\nRoom One\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Ian\n\n\nDescription:\n A thin, pale man in a straitjacket wearing a blindfold sits in the corner of the chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Two\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n The Crying Boy\n\n\nDescription:\n A canvas is set up in the room. A sheet is draped over it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Three\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n The Watchers\n\n\nDescription:\n Three vaguely humanoid figures are huddled in a far corner of the room, looking away from the door. The figures can be seen shifting slightly, but due to lighting conditions within the chamber, no other details can be made out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Four\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n \nNo placard\n\n\nDescription:\n Beyond the door appears to be another dark hallway.\n\n\n\n\nLevel Three\n\n\n\n\nRoom One\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n The Infinite Cold\n\n\nDescription:\n The floor of the chamber is covered with a thin layer of water. The interior of the room seems to be considerably larger than its exterior physical dimensions would allow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Two\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Sorrow\n\n\nDescription:\n A pedestal rests in the middle of the chamber. Four parallel lines in the dust, consistent with finger marks, imply that whatever was upon it has recently been removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Three\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n World Without Man\n\n\nDescription:\n Chamber is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Four\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Adam's Hatred\n\n\nDescription:\n A billowing, indistinct black shape is visible in the back of the room.\n\n\n\n\nLevel Four\n\n\n\n\nRoom One\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n The Morning Star\n\n\nDescription:\n A rusted sword hangs on a rack in the back of the room. The door to the chamber feels warm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Two\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Wormwood\n\n\nDescription:\n Viewport is obscured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Three\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Harmonia's Necklace\n\n\nDescription:\n A simple golden necklace hangs on a post in the back of the room, which is lit by a single tall candle. The chamber does not appear to have a floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Four\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n \nNo placard\n\n\nDescription:\n Chamber is unlit. Individuals who look into this room feel a lingering sense of dread afterward.\n\n\n\n\nLevel Five\n\n\n\n\nRoom One\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n The Heart of Man\n\n\nDescription:\n Inside the chamber is a single, still-beating human heart suspended from the ceiling by a wire. The interior of the chamber appears distorted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Two\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n \nTool marks indicate that placard has been pried off. The word \"hello\" is scratched into the metal where the placard should be.\n\n\nDescription:\n Sliding panel is welded shut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Three\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Channel 55\n\n\nDescription:\n A small, CRT television sits in the center of the room. Something is playing on the screen, but a dark cloth has been draped over the top of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Four\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Living Nightmare\n\n\nDescription:\n A dirty twin mattress on a simple metal frame rests in the middle of the room. A figure is lying on the mattress with a sheet pulled up over them.\n\n\n\n\nLevel Six\n\n\n\n\nRoom One\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Mr. Silence\n\n\nDescription:\n A tall, black, wooden box rests against the back wall. It is bound in chains and locks. A bright purple \"W\" is emblazoned on its front in gold trim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Two\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n The Dead Man's Chair\n\n\nDescription:\n A wooden chair sits in the far corner of the room. A faint shadow can be seen 'sitting' in it, which disappears upon a second viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Three\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n \u00d6tzi\n\n\nDescription:\n A layer of ice covers the viewport and obscures visibility. A dark shape can be seen in the middle of the room, although no details can be distinguished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom Four\n\n\nPlacard Name:\n Apollyon's Crown\n\n\nDescription:\n A silver lockbox rests on a table in the middle of the room. Notably, the exterior of the door is covered in scratch marks, as if by something trying to get into the chamber.\n\n\n\n\nLevel Seven\n\n\nAlthough the opening to the seventh level is visible through the grated floor of the elevator, the lift mechanism appears to have been modified and can no longer access that floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3789\n | SCP-3790 | \nSCP-3791\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3790\n\" by Croquembouche and djkaktus, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
