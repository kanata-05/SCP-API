All other found digital copies of SCP-4816 have been erased.\n\n\nSeveral physical copies of SCP-4816 are stored within a secure containment locker at Site-19.\n\n\nAccess to the digital and/or physical copies of SCP-4816 must be approved by a Level-3 Researcher.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4816 is a non-anomalous photo which displays a doorway and a white text phrase. SCP-4816 was previously capable of altering its contents, and altered to its current state on July 7th, 2018. SCP-4816 previously displayed PoI-6888 \"kkrule\"\n1\n, known member of GoI-5869 \n\"Gamers Against Weed\"\n. Where SCP-4816 was photographed is currently unknown, but is believed to have been in a facility or private home.\n\n\nSee Addendum 1 for further details.\n\n\nAddendum 1:\n When SCP-4816 was initially discovered, it was believed to posess anomalous properties. Following extensive research, however, SCP-4816 was deemed non-anomalous and briefly reclassified to a GoI artifact, though SCP documentation was kept for reference. Following this designation, a search was initiated across the United States on July 5th, 2018, utilizing field agents and Foundation webcrawlers, in search of PoI-6888 using SCP-4816 and several copies of it.\n\n\n38 hours following initiation of the search, SCP-4816's contents were altered. SCP-4816 no longer showed PoI-6888 and had a white text phrase in his place. All digital and physical copies of SCP-4816 were equally altered. The national search was subsequently cancelled, and SCP-4816 was promptly reclassified \"Safe\". Following further research and several months of inactivity, however, SCP-4816 was given its current object class. SCP-4816 has not exhibited anomalous behavior since, and is being considered for a second reclassification.\n\n\nAddendum 2:\n SCP-4816 was initially discovered in a GoI-5869 chatroom by Foundation chatbots. The chat logs discussing SCP-4816 are documented below.\n\n\nBelow is a log from a chatroom including all GoI-5869 members.\n\n\n\n\nkkrule:\n me irl :)\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0show\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0hide\u00a0block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlesbian_gengar:\n LMAO\n\n\nDonDeLillo:\n you fucking idiot\n\n\ngaycopmp4:\n hot\n\n\nbluntfiend:\n Cool, man.\n\n\njockjamsvol6:\n Nice pic @kkrule!
