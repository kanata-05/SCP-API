Past containment attempts are detailed below. MTF Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\") is to focus on keeping SCP-3453 away from the public eye with an array of containment equipment developed by the SCP-3453 Research Team.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3453 is 250mL of orange juice that is in constant motion. While SCP-3453's movements are unpredictable it has always been observed as a continuous whole\n1\n.\n\n\nSCP-3453 was first discovered at Bridgewater Elementary in Idaho Falls, Idaho, where SCP-3453 ejected itself out of its container through a straw and into a student's face. SCP-3453 then moved erratically for 2 hours before going down a sewer drain. 623 individuals were amnesticized with Class C amnestics and 15 video recordings of SCP-3453 were confiscated. SCP-3453 was later contained and transferred to Site-11, where it remained in its containment chamber for 1 month and 46 hours before breaching containment.\n\n\nSince then, SCP-3453 has consistently escaped every containment chamber that has been devised\n2\n. SCP-3453 will spend approximately 1 month, on average, in a given containment unit before breaching containment. Furthermore, SCP-3453 has a record of escaping from re-used containment chambers within a matter of hours. Tests into its sentience remain inconclusive.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Partial\u00a0List\u00a0of\u00a0Notable\u00a0Containment\u00a0Strategies\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Hide\u00a0List\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.1:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nSCP-3453 was enclosed in a watertight containment unit capable of holding 500mL of liquid.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n1 month and 46 hours\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nOver the course of its containment SCP-3453 created and escaped through a 128nm crack in its container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.2:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nSCP-3453 was enclosed in a watertight containment unit capable of holding 500mL of liquid, with 200cm thick walls.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n1 months, 3 days, and 1 hour.\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 heated up to a sufficient temperature to cause its containment unit to explode.\n3\n SCP-3453 quickly cooled down to room temperature and proceeded to wander around Site-11. This event also resulted in the breaches of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as well as 2 casualties of Foundation personnel. All three objects were later re-contained without any additional issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.5:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nSCP-3453 was enclosed in a 300cm thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n2 months, 1 week, 3 days, and 4 hours.\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 teleported 1.5 meters outside of its containment unit. This is the first time that SCP-3453 has been observed to teleport by the SCP-3453 Research Team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.17:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nSCP-3453 was enclosed in a 300cm thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site. This containment unit itself is enclosed in a blast resistant room with a Scranton Reality Anchor, which could prevent teleportation from occurring.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n2 months, 2 weeks, 3 days, and 5 hours.\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 teleported 1.5m outside of its containment unit. After 3 minutes of circling its containment unit at 10kph SCP-3453 teleported inside of the Scranton Reality Anchor, which proceeded to short-circuit and explode.\n\n\nNotes: The Site Director has banned the use of SRAs for containment purposes. They also banned the use of cross-testing with other SCPs. Given the \nmorbidly interesting ways in which these tests have failed for other SCPs\n, I can't say I blame them. The SCP-3453 Research Team is going to take a more conservative approach from here on out. Specifically, we'll be focusing less on a permanent containment solution and more on minimizing the cost and impact of containment breaches.\n\n\n~Senior Researcher Bindell. SCP-3453 Research Team Leader\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.20:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nSCP-3453 is to be transported to a different containment unit every 8 hours. 6 containment units have been created for this purpose. As a cost-saving measure, a containment unit will only be decommissioned and replaced when SCP-3453 has managed to escape it under 48 hours.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n1 year, 2 months, 4 days, and 18 hours.\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 was contained successfully with an average of approximately 0.7 successful escape attempts per month. SCP-3453 has since then teleported outside of every containment unit devised in less than 48 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.49:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nSCP-3453 is to be kept within Site-11 by MTF Beta-7 through an array of cost-effective and portable containment units and procedures. The SCP-3453 Research Team is to provide aid and support to MTF Beta-7.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n1 month, 4 days, and 18 hours.\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 eventually escaped Site-11 through a urinal in the men's restroom.\n\n\nNotes: As of writing this, SCP-3453 has been re-captured and brought back to Site-11 no less than 4 times. Each time that it has been brought back it appears to make a mad dash to the men's bathroom. Its last escape involved teleporting into the urinal. The bathroom has since been closed down, but that's really more of a temporary fix.\n\n\n~Junior Research Assistant Fine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.66:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\n\nContAIner-3453\n, a program dedicated to SCP-3453's containment, has been developed. \nContAIner-3453\n is to assist in automatically producing self-driving containment units for the purpose of finding and capturing SCP-3453 in a safe and discreet manner. Since the artificial intelligence is a work in progress, MTF Beta-7 is expected to work with \nContAIner-3453\n until it can be fully automated by the SCP-3453 Research Team.\n\n\nThis entry marks \nContAIner-3453\n's first successful containment attempt, which involved a derivative of Test 3453.14.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\n1 month, 1 week, and 2 hours.\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 teleported 2.4m outside of its containment unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContainment Strategy 3453.121:\n\n\nContainment Procedure:\n\nThe following note, copied verbatim, was written in a standard issue notebook:\n\n\n\n\nI performed a statistical analysis of\n ContAIner-3453's \ncontainment efforts, and I'm seeing a slow but significant downward trend in average containment time. If my calculations are correct, I don't think that this program will last more than a decade at best. Eventually, this skip will just get bored of us all and leave The Foundation forever\u2026\n\n\nI have an idea.\n\n\nLet the records show that SCP-3453's container is Reality. As long as SCP-3453 exists, it is contained.\n\n\n~Junior Researcher Fine\n\n\n\n\n3 hours after this note was written SCP-3453 disappeared.\n\n\nContainment Time:\n\nN/A\n\n\nContainment Breach Record:\n\nSCP-3453 could not be found for 4 months, 5 days, and 3 hours. SCP-3453's state of existence during this period could not be determined. SCP-3453 was discovered 534km from its place of disappearance by a group of 4 citizens in [REDACTED].
