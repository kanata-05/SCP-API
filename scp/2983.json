Foundation web crawlers are to monitor for mentions of SCP-2983 online. Any suspected SCP-2983 instances are to be tracked down and retrieved. Once secured, all instances of SCP-2983 are to be cataloged and stored in \nSite-55\n's low-risk item storage. Excess and expired instances are to be incinerated.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2983 is a chocolate flavored, rice-based cereal with dehydrated marshmallows named \"Judy's Choco-Wonder Explosion Marshmallow Bites!\u2122\" and labeled under the Dr. Wondertainment (GoI-386) brand. The box of the product depicts a humanoid female with an unusually \nlarge tongue\n1\n outstretching her arms and looking up at an arc made of six unique marshmallow shapes. The nutritional information listed on the side of the box claims its contents possess high levels of nutrients not typically found in cereals such as Omega 3\n2\n and Vitamin B\n3\n while possessing low-Calorie counts and low sugar, fat, and carbohydrates. This conflicts with the known nutritional value of the listed ingredients, such as eggs, sugar, chocolate, corn syrup, and cornstarch.\n\n\nWhen a quantity of milk exceeding 227 grams is poured into a bowl containing SCP-2983, the marshmallows will animate and vocalize. The marshmallows will sing a song typically regarding the importance of proper dental hygiene, exercise, and consuming a balanced diet before ceasing further anomalous behavior. Subjects under the age of 12 regularly claim SCP-2983 to be \"yummy\" and \"the best cereal ever\". However, when consumed by subjects over the age of 12, SCP-2983 is reported to taste similar to unsweetened oatmeal.\n\n\nSCP-2983 manifests with no discernible pattern in supermarkets across western Europe without traceable origin. SCP-2983 can also be purchased at Wondertainment's online store, \"wondertainment.\u2588\u2588\u2588\"\n4\n, specifically under the URL \"sweets.wondertainment.\u2588\u2588\u2588/choco-wonder\".\n\n\nBelow is a table detailing the shapes and nutritional properties of the marshmallows in SCP-2983.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShape\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish\n\n\nContains high amounts of Omega 3 and has been noted to swim during performances. Sings in a bass voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrescent Moon\n\n\nContains high mineral concentration of calcium and magnesium. Sings in a baritone voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrumpet\n\n\nContains the highest mineral concentration of SCP-2983. Sings in a tenor voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkull\n\n\nContains high levels of calcium and vitamin D3. Sings in a countertenor voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandy\n\n\nIs noted to be the sweetest tasting of the marshmallows. Sings in a soprano voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\nThe marshmallow is invisible\n5\n, rendering research into its properties difficult. Sings in a tenor voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\u00a07/18/2002\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\nOn 7/01/2002, the following message was posted at the bottom of the SCP-2983 vendor page.\n\n\n\n\nPRIZE INPUT:\n\n\nFor \nyour\n chance to win an \nextra special\n Wondertainment prize, input your code (that you can find on the inside of \nevery cereal box!\n) into the bar below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Only someone over 18 years of age may accept a Wondertainment special prize. Make sure to tell your parents if you are participating in our giveaway!\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this change, SCP-2983 boxes began to include codes on their insides. Codes were six characters long but included esoteric symbols which were unable to be typed unless they had previously been observed (identified as common Shibboleth Runes). This rendered bot-enabled code-inputting impossible, leaving only the option to purchase SCP-2983 to test codes. Researcher May Waters was tasked with cataloging and inputting codes.\n\n\nDue to the uncertainty of the \"prize\" advertised on the vendor page, the SCP-2983 research team has been allotted a budgetary increase of $20,000.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 11/12/2002:\n Following an increase of manifestations within grocers in Germany and Austria, Head Researcher May Waters pushed for, and was later granted, a budgetary increase of $100,000 at the discretion of Site-55's Budgetary Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 12/27/2002:\n Manifestations of SCP-2983 have been confirmed in France, Belgium, and Italy. The increase of manifestations has necessitated a budgetary increase of $900,000. Further budgetary increases are subject to O5 Council approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 01/08/2003:\n Reports of SCP-2983 manifestations throughout most of Europe, the British Isles, and Northern Africa have been confirmed by Foundation field agents. Reclassification to Keter is currently pending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Addendum\u00a02/27/2003\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\n\n\n\n\nOn 2/18/2003, the following message was posted at the top of the SCP-2983 vendor page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWowwee!!\n\n\nWe here at Wonder World\u2122 are just so delighted that \nyou're\n delighted by Judy's Choco-Wonder Explosion Marshmallow Bites!\u2122 We had to work through several Snoozedays just to meet demands, but never fear, now that we've expanded our Sweets & Consumables Department we'll be able to pump out more of Judy's Choco-Wonder Explosion Marshmallow Bites!\u2122, as well as what we hope will become some new favorites.

An O5 Council meeting was held to vote on the allocation of additional funds to SCP-2983 research team, based on the possibility of the anomaly becoming easily obtainable by civilians, as well as the uncertainty of the contents of said \"prizes\".\n\n\nThe following document details an O5 meeting report regarding SCP-2983.\n\n\n\n\nO5 COUNCIL PROPOSAL SUMMARY\n\n\nPROPOSAL:\n\n\n \n\"Allot a budgetary increase of 120 million USD to the SCP-2983 acquisition team at the request of Researcher Waters.\"\n\n\nCOUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEA\n\n\nNAY\n\n\nABSTAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-03\n\n\nO5-01\n\n\nO5-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-05\n\n\nO5-02\n\n\nO5-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-06\n\n\nO5-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-07\n\n\nO5-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-10\n\n\nO5-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO5-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPROVED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n \n The importance of acquiring the advertised prizes on SCP-2983 is currently considered a Code Orange Foundation priority.

Researcher May Waters would receive an email (despite never having entered an email into \"wondertainment.\u2588\u2588\u2588\") for each prize, and then have said prize materialize in her lap at the next convenient moment. Below is a list of acquired prizes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #\n\n\nAcquired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAO-4002\n\n\n3/02/2003\n\n\nA toy whose function is antimemetic.

The email was immediately followed by a second email, confirming that May Waters was in possession of all the SCP-2983 associated prizes and that the \"super-ultra-mega prize\" would arrive in 3-5 business days.\n\n\nUpon receiving said email, Researcher May Waters purposefully isolated herself within a standard humanoid containment chamber, instructing Site staff to treat her as an anomalous humanoid until the prize had arrived, and to then approach the prize with caution and take it into testing.\n\n\nOn 4/16/2003, a cylindrical container, encased in purple and yellow wrapping paper and ribbons, materialized in Researcher Waters' lap. The \"prize\" was designated URA-5350. No memetic, antimemetic, or cognitohazardous properties were discovered by Researcher Waters nor by Neuro-Sims within the containment chamber. Researcher May Waters was instructed to open URA-5350 by Dr. Everwood. No anomalous effects were reported.\n\n\nAfter further testing revealed no further anomalous properties, URA-5350 (now AO-4006) was scheduled for neutralization. However, Researcher Waters professed the wish to hang AO-4006 inside her office. After a final inspection confirmed no further anomalous properties, Researcher Waters was allowed to keep AO-4006. As of 5/23/2003, SCP-2983's research budget has been reduced by 75%.\n\n\nTo date, no SCP-2983 instances have indicated further prize giveaways. SCP-2983 has been reclassified as Safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Anomalous Object 4006\n- Accessing file...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem #:\n AO-4006\n\n\nItem Description:\n A poster, depicting the GoI-386 associated anomalous musical performance group \"The Little Misters\".

        "EDIT 11/12/2002: Following an increase of manifestations within grocers in Germany and Austria, Head Researcher May Waters pushed for, and was later granted, a budgetary increase of $100,000 at the discretion of Site-55's Budgetary Committee.",
        "EDIT 12/27/2002: Manifestations of SCP-2983 have been confirmed in France, Belgium, and Italy. The increase of manifestations has necessitated a budgetary increase of $900,000. Further budgetary increases are subject to O5 Council approval.",

        "May, The space on the back of this poster is not large enough to tell you how much you mean to me. I've never met you, but I feel like we know each other, in some cosmic sort of way. I never expected anyone could have ever bought so much cereal, but your brand-loyalty has been nothing short of a spectacle. I can only reasonably come to the conclusion that you are a philanthropist who knows of the plight of the Candy Catalysts, and have been spending vast amounts of money to help us out of the rut we've been in for decades. I'm sorry if a simple poster is too small a gift from me to you, as I would imagine it would feel like. But I assure you that your contributions have been more than just noticed. \"May Waters, 2nd Founder of the Sweets & Consumables Department\" Look for your name on some upcoming products, and I hope to meet you in person one day. Your secret admirer, Judy the Tongue \u2764",

    "description": "SCP-2983 is a chocolate flavored, rice-based cereal with dehydrated marshmallows named \"Judy's Choco-Wonder Explosion Marshmallow Bites!\u2122\" and labeled under the Dr. Wondertainment (GoI-386) brand. The box of the product depicts a humanoid female with an unusually large tongue1 outstretching her arms and looking up at an arc made of six unique marshmallow shapes. The nutritional information listed on the side of the box claims its contents possess high levels of nutrients not typically found in cereals such as Omega 32 and Vitamin B3 while possessing low-Calorie counts and low sugar, fat, and carbohydrates. This conflicts with the known nutritional value of the listed ingredients, such as eggs, sugar, chocolate, corn syrup, and cornstarch.",
