Once activated, they both targeted Selene-Site-129. We do not yet know at the time of writing this document why both instances carried out this action, although we do not know whether they were conscious or not from the beginning, and surely, we will probably never know.\n\n\nHowever, when that event occurred, staff members sleeping in each other's assigned rooms on the upper floor described that as SCP-5684 struck the facility with blinding splendor, they felt a shocking warmth and happy feeling. A feeling that was widely described as \"similar to when a friend of yours achieves something that he wanted for a long time.\" In addition, the staff who were awake at the time felt a joyful feeling, one that lasted throughout the next month.\n\n\nAdditionally, not only did this occur but after the event, some 200 meters from Selene-Site-129, a monolith of a mineral similar to common amethyst could be found. Once we went exploring and checked the perimeter, it was possible to see that there was something inscribed on the figure that read:\n\n\n\n\nTo my love, a coin.\n\nFor my love, I'd give my life.\n\nFor my love, I'd reach the moon.\n\nAnd with my love, forever I'll stay.\n\n\n\n\nThere have been no further incidents. SCP-5684 is considered neutralized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Res. Maia Ross.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.
