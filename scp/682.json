At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682, only able to cause massive physical damage. SCP-682 should be contained within a 5\u00a0m x 5\u00a0m x 5\u00a0m chamber with 25\u00a0cm reinforced acid-resistant steel plate lining all inside surfaces. The containment chamber should be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-682 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempts of SCP-682 to move, speak, or breach containment should be reacted to quickly and with full force as called for by the circumstances.\n\n\nPersonnel are forbidden to speak to SCP-682, for fear of provoking a rage-state. All unauthorized personnel attempting to communicate to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force.\n\n\nDue to its frequent attempts at containment breach, difficulty of containment and incapacitation, and high threat of Foundation Exposure, SCP-682 is to be contained in site [REDACTED]. The Foundation will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of human development.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with \nSCP-079\n during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B).\n\n\nSCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682's physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material. SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. Digestion seems to be aided by a set of filtering gills inside of SCP-682's nostrils, which are able to remove usable matter from any liquid solution, enabling it to constantly regenerate from the acid it is contained in. SCP-682's regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed or rotted.\n\n\nIn case of containment breach, SCP-682 is to be tracked and re-captured by all available Mobile Task Forces, and no teams with fewer than seven (7) members are cleared to engage it. To date (\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum 682-D).\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 682-B:\n Portion of recorded transcript of \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n.\n\n\n\n\n<Begin Log, skip to 00h-21m-52s>\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Now, why did you kill those farmers?\n\n\nSCP-682:\n (No verbal communication)\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n If you don't talk now, we will remove you from this attempt and place you back into-\n\n\nSCP-682:\n (Incomprehensible)\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Pardon?
