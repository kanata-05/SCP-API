Access requires minimum Clearance 2 with authorization and supervision by Clearance 3 research and security staff respectively. Supervising personnel are not to view SCP-1230's contents. Personnel accessing SCP-1230 are required to submit written accounts of dreams experienced within 48 hours of access.\n (See Addendum-1230-A) SCP-1230 has been relocated to a secure storage locker behind the desk of Site-12's main library. Access is available to Clearance 2 personnel deemed to be in satisfactory psychological condition by site psychiatric staff. Personnel accessing SCP-1230 must submit written accounts of their dreams within 48 hours of access and submit to follow-up psychological examination.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-1230 is an unlabeled, green hardcover book with no apparent exceptional qualities. When SCP-1230 is opened, it displays the phrase \u201cA hero is born\u201d on the first page viewed, while all other pages will be blank, \"resetting\" once the book is closed. This has no obvious effects at first, but upon falling asleep, the reader will dream of a fantasy world where they are the protagonist of a troubled land. Dreamers are completely aware and all senses work just as well as when awake. Results vary depending on the imagination of the reader and are mostly attuned to fantasies of adventure that the reader would enjoy. In the mind of the reader, these dreams have been documented to last anywhere from 45 seconds (see Experiment 1230-3) to 200 years (see Experiment 1230-5) but in reality, the reader will usually never be asleep longer than they would normally. Upon awaking, the reader is able to remember every aspect of their dream in detail. In SCP-1230-induced dreams, there is always a character called the \u201cBook Keeper\u201d (SCP-1230-1) appearing as a bearded man in a green cloak who claims to be the personification of SCP-1230 himself. SCP-1230-1 has been reported to be very amicable and helpful towards dreamers. It has stated that it enjoys creating these \u201cfantasy-scapes\u201d and always tries to shape them in such a way that the dreamer garners the most entertainment out of it. It has expressed sorrow when the dream comes to an end and asks the dreamer to \u201cplease visit again soon\u201d.\n\n\nDiscovery:\n In a small bookstore located [DATA EXPUNGED] the shopkeeper had no recollection of owning the unlabeled book but attempted to sell a story to local newspapers about a \u201cmagical dream book\u201d. The Foundation was able to dispel the story as a hoax and SCP-1230 was confiscated.\n\n\nExperiment-1230-01:\n Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, in an attempt to test its effective range, opened SCP-1230 and boarded a flight to his hometown of [REDACTED] where he spent the night at a hotel. Upon his return, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that SCP-1230-1 appeared in his dreams and explained that once you read \u2018A hero is born\u2019, the dream is immediately implanted in your subconscious, after which SCP-1230-1 is able to manipulate it remotely. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 expressed his appreciation for SCP-1230-1\u2019s cooperation.\n\n\nExperiment-1230-02:\n A camera was set-up above SCP-1230 and, using a mechanical \u201carm\u201d, the book was opened. All pages were revealed to be blank. It seems SCP-1230 is only effective when opened by beings that are able to have dreams. SCP-1230-1 explained to a subsequent dreamer that it is actually only able to affect beings \u201cwith an imagination\u201d and that most creatures such as animals would not be affected.\n\n\nExperiment-1230-03:\n One (1) D-class was instructed to open the book and (after much reassurance that his experiences would only be dreams) ordered to immediately find a way to kill himself in the dream. The subject was asleep for merely 45 seconds before he awoke with a start in a nervous sweat. He reported being at the summit of a volcano called \u201cThe Ashen Spire\u201d on a quest for \u201cCaladius, the Blessed Blade\u201d. When asked how the subject knew the names, he stated, \u201cIt\u2019s like I knew them all along\u201d. He apparently leapt into the volcano and \u201cfelt an intense heat\u201d before awakening. D-class requested permission to \"give it another go\". Request was denied.\n\n\nExperiment-1230-04:\n One (1) D-class was instructed to open the book and attempt to non-fatally injure himself in his dream. After 6 hours, the D-class awoke and reported that he was able to feel a \u201cnumbed\u201d sort of pain where it was never so intense as to be unbearable. He also reported meeting an elderly, cloaked man who asked him why he was harming himself, but thanked him for not immediately killing himself \u201clike that other rude fellow\u201d.\n\n\nExperiment-1230-05:\n Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 filed a request for access to SCP-1230 and was quickly permitted, given his Level 4 clearance. Staff members recalled that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was almost \u201cvisibly shaking with excitement\u201d and some reported that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was an avid fan of tabletop and role-playing games. Surveillance shows that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 opened the book, read the phrase, sat down beside the desk and promptly fell asleep. Staff members were alarmed when Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 did not awake after 15 hours and alerted security. The on-site medical staff were able to confirm that Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was still alive and in good health. After approximately 24 hours since falling asleep, Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 began to move, reported to have \"slowly raised his head and looked around the room, appearing deeply confused\". Security entered the room to ensure he was alright, to which he replied, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d. He was sent to Medical where staff explained where and who he was. Several minutes later, Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 appeared to have regained his memory and excused himself to the restroom. When 15 minutes passed and Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had not exited, a nurse entered to find he had hanged himself with his belt. A scribbled message on the wall revealed his last words: \u201cI can\u2019t go back to this\u201d. Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 went to ask SCP-1230-1 what had happened, but upon opening SCP-1230, all its pages were soaking wet with the same message on every page: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never intended for this to happen. I just wanted to make people happy.\u201d repeated over and over. SCP-1230 remained in this state for three weeks and its desk had to be wiped dry biweekly. In an attempt to communicate, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 placed a sticky note inside SCP-1230 with the statement, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you, if that\u2019s alright\u201d. The next morning, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 filed a report about a dream he had concerning SCP-1230-1.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Report-1230-14\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Report-1230-14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon falling asleep last night, I dreamt I was in a dark void. There was a streetlamp and underneath it was SCP-1230-1 sitting in a puddle. His cloak was visibly soaked and he was sobbing profusely. I remember our conversation:\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n: Book Keeper? Is that you? My god, man, where are we?\n\n\nBook Keeper:\n \n(between sobs)\n I\u2026 couldn\u2019t think of anything to make for a landscape.\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n Book Keeper\u2026 what happened that day? Why did Professor B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 kill himself? We have to know your side of the story.\n\n\nBook Keeper:\n \n(wiping his eyes)\n He had such an active imagination! I was able to create a vast and beautiful universe for him and it was obvious that he had wanted a life like that for so long. He conquered foul beasts and rescued princesses\u2026 He built kingdoms and even raised a family\u2026 but he never wanted to leave. He delved so far into his fantasy world that I soon realized he preferred his dream over the real world. I reminded him that this was all merely an illusion, but he wouldn\u2019t listen to me. He stated that if he was ever forced to leave, he would immediately end his life. I tried to keep him happy for as long as I could\u2026\n\n\nDr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\n \u2026Book Keeper\u2026 how long was the dream from his point of view?\n\n\nBook Keeper:\n \u2026200 years, Doctor. I did my best but I could only hold onto him for 200 years. As sweet as dreams may be, eventually we all have to wake up.\n\n\nI awoke almost immediately after. I can\u2019t believe he spent 200 years in his dream. I\u2019m astounded by his foolishness but it\u2019s such a shame to have lost a brilliant mind to his own delusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the report was filed, surveillance showed Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 slipping another small paper into SCP-1230. A few days later, SCP-1230 began showing its usual \u201cA hero is born\u201d greeting once again. When asked what the note said, Dr. F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 declined to give detailed comment, simply stating that he \"just gave it some friendly advice\".\n\n\nAddendum-1230-A:\n During initial testing, SCP-1230-1 asked dreaming personnel if it could be relocated to an area with many books (preferably fiction) so that it could think of even better ways to construct its \u201cfantasy-scapes\u201d. After numerous experiments were performed to ensure that SCP-1230 posed no threat, the request was accepted and SCP-1230 has been relocated to Site-12's library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-1229\n | SCP-1230 | \nSCP-1231\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-1230\n\" by MrPixel, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
