Any instances of SCP-4269 are to be washed and disinfected thoroughly before and after any experimentation.\n\n\nInstances of SCP-4269 are not to be used for recreational reasons by any personnel.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-4269 is the collective designation for several pairs of cognitohazardous undergarments created by GoI-7058 (Inevitability Industries). Any subject who wears an instance of SCP-4269 is known as an instance of SCP-4269-1. Subjects who view SCP-4269-1 instances will perceive them as a person they would consider their ideal standard of sexual attractiveness. This anomalous effect extends to all senses, including touch, taste and smell.\n\n\nDifferent subjects may see different people when viewing and interacting with an SCP-4269-1 instance, and one subject may view multiple different people if viewing more than one SCP-4269-1 instance. The only known restriction of SCP-4269's cognitohazardous effects is it will not alter an SCP-4269-1 instance's gender to the subject viewing it.\n\n\nBelow is an abridged list of SCP-4269-1 instances as viewed by Foundation Personnel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nSCP-4269-1 Manifestation\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Geraldine Stearns\n\n\nSubject reported the instance looked like American Actor Dwayne Johnson wearing only an apron.\n\n\nSCP-4269 is capable of simulating realistic-feeling clothing and additional body mass, as the SCP-4269-1 instance was four inches shorter than Dwayne Johnson and was not wearing any clothing beyond SCP-4269.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Arthur Cordelia\n\n\nSubject reported the instance was a tall, broad-shouldered, tan-skinned woman with long black hair and a toned body.\n\n\nSCP-4269-1 instances do not need to be any specific people, but rather a concept that the subject finds attractive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Connor Finn\n\n\nSubject reported the instance did not change in appearance.\n\n\nSCP-4269-1 instances do not necessarily need to change appearance if the subject already finds them attractive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Fiona Mariah\n\n\nSubject reported the instance became a scaled lizard-like woman with clawed hands and feet and an elongated tail.\n\n\nSCP-4269-1 instances do not necessarily have to be human or humanoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanitor Frank Robertson\n\n\nSubject reported the instance was a woman wearing a black latex suit that covered their entire body save for their feet.\n\n\nTest was accidental as Mr. Robertson had been passing by the Site-73 low-security testing area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident 4269-03:\n On September 28th, 19\u2588\u2588, Researcher Wendy Flanders had reportedly requested an instance of SCP-4269 for experimentation purposes, but had not returned it for several days.\n\n\nThe following are several tests made by Researcher Flanders that were discovered on her personal computer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Wendy Flanders\n\n\nSubject reported the instance looking like her ex-girlfriend.\n\n\nSCP-4269-1 instance was placed on a female \nCanis lupus familiaris\n, indicating subjects do not need to be the same species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Wendy Flanders\n\n\nSubject reported the instance looking like a different ex-girlfriend.\n\n\nSCP-4269-1 instance was placed on a humanoid mannequin, indicating subjects do not need to be alive or ever have been living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Wendy Flanders\n\n\nSubject reported the instance looking like \nSCP-035\n on the body of an ex-girlfriend.\n\n\nOh God yes\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead Researcher Wendy Flanders\n\n\nSubject reported the instance looking like Researcher Fiona Mariah.\n\n\nSCP-4269 can fulfill your wildest dreams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the testing, investigation of Researcher Flanders had revealed that she had kept the SCP-4269 instance for several days after concluding her tests, and had placed it on the base of a lamp in her office along with other pieces of lingerie and a silicone phallus.\n\n\nResearcher Flanders has been severely reprimanded, including removal as Head Researcher on the SCP-4269 project, and prohibition of working with any humanoid SCP Objects.\n\n\nResearcher Fiona Mariah has since requested to be transferred to a different Foundation Site after the events of Incident 4269-03. The request has been granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-4268\n | SCP-4269 | \nSCP-4270\n \u00bb",
