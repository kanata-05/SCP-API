A fence has been erected around the perimeter of the park, and locals have been notified of an environmental hazard in order to discourage attempts at entry. Security personnel are to maintain a distance of at least five meters from SCP-3225. Physical contact with SCP-3225 is only permitted with the permission of the presiding Site Director. Individuals who show signs of unusual interest in SCP-3225 are to be detained for questioning.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3225 is a set of five translucent humanoid figures standing in an incomplete circle formation. It is intangible to inanimate objects, though living organisms are able to interact with SCP-3225 as if it is solid. Individuals who have done so describe SCP-3225 as warm and similar to glass in texture.\n\n\nAll organisms in the immediate vicinity of SCP-3225 experience reduced aggression and a feeling of calm. This intensifies in closer proximity to SCP-3225. A subject who joins the circle and takes hold of SCP-3225's hands will enter a state similar to REM sleep and become unresponsive to external stimuli. The subject is capable of disengaging at any time they choose. Subjects in physical contact with SCP-3225 remain susceptible to malnutrition, dehydration and other forms of physical injury.\n\n\nDuring contact, subjects are able to communicate with the set of entities collectively known as SCP-3225-1. SCP-3225-1 is reported to be benevolent and intensely empathetic, and appears to be able to communicate with any subject regardless of spoken language. Subjects are unable to recall exact details of their contact with SCP-3225-1 after contact is broken.\n\n\nSCP-3225 appeared in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Oregon on 23 September 1996. Six individuals were reported missing in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 shortly following SCP-3225's appearance; it is believed that five of these individuals now make up SCP-3225. Efforts to locate the sixth (\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, believed to be the author of Document 3225-B) have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a03225-A\u00a0-\u00a0Journal\u00a0entry\u00a0dated\u00a020\u00a0September\u00a01996\n\n\n\n\n-Document\u00a03225-A\u00a0-\u00a0Journal\u00a0entry\u00a0dated\u00a020\u00a0September\u00a01996\n\n\n\n\nNote: Excerpt from a journal belonging to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, one of the six missing persons thought to be connected to SCP-3225's appearance. It was found at the owner's residence on 30 September, 1996, alongside Document 3225-B and several anomalous objects (refer to Recovery File 3225).\n\n\n\n\nI used to think that being alive was going to be hard forever and that was just how things are. This last year, exploring with the others, I've learned how wrong I was. I'm not as scared of who I am anymore. I used to walk outside and feel ashamed, like I was doing something wrong by just existing. Here, I feel like I belong. And I can tell the others feel the same. Maybe we can't ever get well (if that's even possible), but having them with me and having the dream to escape to has helped me get better. It's helped us all get better.\n\n\nSo I've been thinking - why do we have to keep coming back? Why don't we just stay there, away from all the bullshit we have to deal with here? I feel crazy even thinking about it, but people have been calling me crazy ever since I was 15. Why not just leave for good next time?\n\n\nThe way we do it would be slightly different to before, but not too much. It should be pretty easy to do. I'll ask the others. We've gotten this far together - I can't imagine doing this without them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Document\u00a03225-B\u00a0-\u00a0Letter\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Document\u00a03225-B\u00a0-\u00a0Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey guys. I don't know if you'll actually read this, but it doesn't feel right to leave without saying anything.\n\n\nThe world treated all of us rough. Parents that didn't want us, guys that wanted us too much. We all wanted to escape. And we did. We managed to leave our broken parts behind, together. When everyone tried to hold us down, we flew to places they couldn't reach us. I've seen beautiful things with all of you, and I am so grateful for that. But now that we're leaving for good, I don't think I can go through with it.\n\n\nParadise is only paradise if you believe you belong there. I don't think I do. I can't just leave all my baggage behind. I know you'd all disagree, so I didn't say anything. Don't worry about me. You gave me the strength to be able to make it on my own or die trying. You all deserved better than you got, and I hope you find it. Thanks for everything. I'll see you in my dreams.\n\n\nJamie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab \nSCP-3224\n | SCP-3225 | \nSCP-3226\n \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\n\n\nCite this page as:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"\nSCP-3225\n\" by Edapurg, from the \nSCP Wiki\n.
