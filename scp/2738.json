As tests have shown that SCP-2738 is potentially spread between registers and between retailers through the use of items anomalously transacted using the SCP-2738 program, such as prepaid cards or gift cards, a cover story of SCP-2738 being a credit theft program has been fully developed and spread to the upper management of all major US retailers.\n\n\nWhen SCP-2738 is found on a register system, the store's district manager is to contact Site-12 personnel and by extension MTF Lambda-13 personnel for containment operations. All retail employees, including high-level managers, are to be kept under the guise that Lambda-13 personnel and any involved Foundation research personnel are FBI agents investigating credit theft.\n\n\nAs investigations carried out by Foundation statisticians have shown that SCP-2738's spread rate is increasing, research efforts toward safe removal of SCP-2738 from register systems are ongoing.\n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-2738 is an unlicensed software of no determinable origin which anomalously manifests in the computer systems of American retailers, first discovered on March 14, 2014. SCP-2738 functions by running alongside each respective retailer\u2019s default POS (Point of Sale) program at checkout registers. Unless the default POS program's window is minimized to allow access to Task Manager or someone is observing a register computer while it boots\n1\n, SCP-2738 is undetectable.\n\n\nUpon direct, intentional launch on Microsoft Windows\n2\n, the register will display the title \u201cM.L. Initiative POS Systems,\u201d the associated logo, and the current software version and year. When fully loaded, SCP-2738\u2019s main screen appears the same as the default software used by the computer on which the program is launched; if SCP-2738 is launched on a computer without register software installed, it will display an error screen with the text \u201cPLEASE RECONNECT ME\u201d in the center and become unresponsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of what is displayed when SCP-2738 is intentionally launched. Screenshot taken on a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 register during Test A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf numbers are entered into the space used for ringing up product SKUs/UPCs\n3\n, SCP-2738 will in response display the transaction of seemingly random products from the store in which it is being used, despite the product SKU/UPC not matching the numbers entered; if the sale is completed, the store\u2019s digital inventory will change\n4\n as if the transaction was processed normally. No history of abnormal input will be apparent, despite the products never having been present at the register.\n\n\nOf note is the fact that products transacted by these means will not require any monetary exchange to complete the sale; the system will instead automatically print a receipt with the total tender plus sales tax that would have been transacted normally immediately after the order is totaled. The receipt and products \u2018sold\u2019 are non-anomalous with the exception of the payment method displayed on the receipt, which will in all cases read \u201cVisa MasterCard ending in -XXXX.\u201d\n5\n The presence of two conflicting card companies is thus far the only way to successfully detect an SCP-2738-affected transaction.\n\n\nItems rung up in response to numerical input are done so in no observable order, and appear to be selected arbitrarily from store inventory. However, after several tests involving the input of English translated into numbers via a basic substitution cipher\n6\n were completed, it was hypothesized that SCP-2738 program instances are sentient\n7\n and appears to respond to alphanumeric input by selecting products intentionally.\n\n\nWhen SCP-2738 is communicated with through means of alphanumeric input, items transacted will be removed from both digital store inventory (as normal) as well as their physical locations on the sales floor. This process is instantaneous, and can be easily observed on CCTV surveillance, albeit with no clear visual signs shown of what happens to objects when they are removed. This process occurs with no temperature changes, Hume level spikes, radiation level spikes, or electrical/electromagnetic discharge present.\n\n\nHistory and Recovery:\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0show\u00a0August\u00a012,\u00a02014\u00a0test\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0collapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest A: August 12, 2014\n\n\nOn August 10, 2014, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 store managers were informed of SCP-2738 presence in their register systems, with the cover story in use that the program is a suspected credit card theft malware and Lambda-13 personnel are Federal Bureau of Investigation officers. Agents Fredericks, Shaw, and Jameson of MTF Lambda-13 posed as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 employees repairing a register on a low-traffic end of the store in order to test SCP-2738.\n\n\nNote: Agent Fredericks' messages are keyed in using the aforementioned alphanumeric method as if he is inputting product SKUs into the register. SCP-2738\u2019s responses are displayed as line items rung up as if present at checkout, with the SKUs matching those actually used in the store for each respective item. In later observance of CCTV footage, it is seen that all items transacted disappear from the sales floor in the manner outlined previously.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks (typing):\n 8-5-12-12-15\n8\n\n\nSCP-2738:\n 3X5 GREETING CARD <S> | 1001-342-301 | 2.97\n\n\n\n\nAgent Fredericks (typing):\n 4-15\u00a025-15-21\u00a019-16-5-1-11\n9\n\n\nSCP-2738:\n 3X5 GREETING CARD <S> | 1001-342-301 | 2.97\n\n\n\n\nAgent Fredericks pauses.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks (typing):\n 8-21-14-7-18-25\n10\n\n\nSCP-2738:\n CANDY <S> | 1000-002-345 | 1.98\n\n\n\n\nAgent Fredericks (typing):\n 14-5-5-4\u00a08-5-12-16\n11\n\n\nSCP-2738:\n VISA PREPAID <S> | 0000-011-233 | 100.00\n\n\nSCP-2738:\n GIFT CARD ACTIVATION FEE | 2.45\n\n\n\n\nAgent Fredericks (typing):\n 4-1-14-7-5-18\n12\n\n\nSCP-2738:\n PNEU.

However, items transacted do not return to their pre-transaction locations on the sales floor, and are not present in the store (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn October 05, 2014, Agent Fredericks reported to his supervisors that a prepaid card for 100 USD had appeared in his wallet behind his other cards, and that he was not certain when it had appeared. As Agent Fredericks confirmed that he did not purchase nor receive a prepaid card at any point in the past several months, it was suspected that the card originated from the test transaction he carried out on August 12, 2014. Agent Fredericks was permitted to use the card at a Foundation front company, West End Used Books, located several kilometers from the site, and it was confirmed that the card had indeed been activated for its full 100-dollar value regardless of the fact that Agent Fredericks had cancelled the transaction in question before it was completed and the card was not present at the register.\n\n\nOn October 07, 2014, cashiers at West End Used Books contacted Site-12 personnel with complaints of \"M.L. Initiative POS Systems\" being displayed briefly upon powering on their registers in the morning. MTF Lambda-13 members were sent to investigate, and were found to confirm SCP-2738 presence in register software; tests similar to that of August 12, 2014 were conducted, with similar results.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0show\u00a0October\u00a007,\u00a02014\u00a0test\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0collapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest B: October 07, 2014\n\n\nIn this test, further communication with SCP-2738 was attempted.

Thus far, only one out of four registers at this location are affected. After checking Agent Fredericks' receipt from October 05, it was confirmed that the register on which SCP-2738 is installed is the same register that processed his transaction using the prepaid card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing knowledge inferred from recent tests, it is apparent that items transacted when communicating with SCP-2738 are anomalously transferred to the possession of whoever carried out the transaction. Agent Fredericks has thus far found the following items in his possession without memory of purchasing them:\n\n\n\n\nOne prepaid card with a value of 100 USD, found in his wallet (10.05.14)\n\n\nTwo greeting cards, found in his right desk drawer within his office in Site-12 (10.09.14)\n\n\nOne candy bar, found in his kitchen cabinet in his personnel quarters (10.20.14)\n\n\nOne pneumatic nailgun, found in the bed of his truck (10.25.14)\n\n\nOne pocket knife, found in his pants (11.02.14)\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Agent Shaw later found \nThe Andromeda Strain\n by Michael Crichton, \nUnderstanding Viruses: Edition 3\n, a biology textbook by Teri Shors, and \nUncontainable\n by Kip Tindell on his bookshelf in his quarters. Shaw reports that he did not previously possess any of the books before November 2014, though he is not certain of when exactly the books appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\u25bc\u00a0show\u00a0November\u00a030,\u00a02014\u00a0interview\u00a0log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b2\u00a0collapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 29, 2014, an employee at West End Used Books contacted MTF Lambda-13 personnel with complaints of SCP-2738 activity on the store's affected register, despite having had said register powered down since shortly after the test carried out on October 07.\n\n\nInterviewer:\n Agent Fredericks\n\n\nInterviewed:\n Meg Saunders, West End Used Books cashier and former Foundation secretary at Site-12\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Alright, let's begin. Yesterday, you called your site contact to discuss SCP-2738's presence on your bookstore's register. This is the same register used in the tests carried out on October seventh, yes?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n That's correct.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Alright, and can you describe the activity your store has seen since then?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Yes. It only started up again the day before yesterday, near closing time, which is why we reached out to you immediately in the morning.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Alright.\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n I was ringing up a customer on another register when I saw an inventory notification in the corner of the screen. We get those when the truck comes and we have new stuff added into the store's computer inventory, but the truck only comes on Tuesdays, and the day before yesterday was a Friday, so I thought that was weird. When I was done with the customer, I read through the inventory and we'd had a bunch of stuff added that we'd either sold out of completely or never carried.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Okay. Can you provide our personnel with a printout of that screen?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Oh, of course. I don't know why I didn't think to do that, sorry.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n It's alright. Do you recall any of the titles?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Oh yeah, yeah. We had one that we'd sold out of months ago - \nAnthem\n by Ayn Rand. That one stood out to me because I distinctly remembered our distributor telling me personally a few weeks back that we wouldn't be getting any copies unless a customer came in and sold one to us, but here we were with the inventory showing three new copies of it.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Alright, and what else?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Several books on viruses.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Computer viruses or biological viruses?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Both. We'd had a textbook on biological viruses once, but that was it, so it was odd to get so many other ones in at once. At least a dozen virus books, all nonfiction.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Anything else?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Yes, uh, \nThe Communist Manifesto,\n the one and only. Five copies of it. I knew we didn't carry that - hell, do they even print and sell copies anymore?\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Were these products visible on the store shelves, or simply present in digital inventory?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n I had my coworkers and I look for them, but we couldn't find them in the usual sections. We could ask the truck driver, but I figured we should ask you guys before talking to anyone about it. Not sure if the driver is Foundation and all that.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n They should be, yes. But thank you for your caution.\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n No problem, no problem. I used to work in this site.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n So you couldn't find these inventory additions on the shelves?\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Like I said, not that I'm aware of. But they're cluttered in the bargain bin and some of the back areas of the store; they very well could be hiding in there, but none of us could find them. We only called you guys because of those tests you all were running back in October - figured this might have something to do with that.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n It certainly sounds like that, yes. If you find copies of the false inventory additions, please refrain from selling them until we figure out the situation.\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n No problem. You're not going to amnesticize me, are you?\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n No, you're a useful asset in that location, and your employment history with this site makes you more than qualified. Please fully cooperate with Lambda-13 personnel when we come to investigate.\n\n\nMs. Saunders:\n Of course, of course. Thanks, agent.\n\n\nAgent Fredericks:\n Thank you.\n\n\nMeg Saunders has been instructed to avoid the use of the SCP-2738-affected register in the store, as well as to monitor digital inventory for any further anomalies. West End Used Books' delivery driver was contacted and briefly interviewed, but did not report delivery of any of the products discussed by Ms. Saunders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjected pattern of SCP-2738 growth.

We'd had a textbook on biological viruses once, but that was it, so it was odd to get so many other ones in at once. At least a dozen virus books, all nonfiction. Agent Fredericks: Anything else? Ms. Saunders: Yes, uh, The Communist Manifesto, the one and only. Five copies of it. I knew we didn't carry that - hell, do they even print and sell copies anymore? Agent Fredericks: Were these products visible on the store shelves, or simply present in digital inventory? Ms. Saunders: I had my coworkers and I look for them, but we couldn't find them in the usual sections. We could ask the truck driver, but I figured we should ask you guys before talking to anyone about it. Not sure if the driver is Foundation and all that. Agent Fredericks: They should be, yes. But thank you for your caution. Ms. Saunders: No problem, no problem. I used to work in this site. Agent Fredericks: So you couldn't find these inventory additions on the shelves? Ms. Saunders: Like I said, not that I'm aware of. But they're cluttered in the bargain bin and some of the back areas of the store; they very well could be hiding in there, but none of us could find them. We only called you guys because of those tests you all were running back in October - figured this might have something to do with that. Agent Fredericks: It certainly sounds like that, yes. If you find copies of the false inventory additions, please refrain from selling them until we figure out the situation. Ms. Saunders: No problem. You're not going to amnesticize me, are you? Agent Fredericks: No, you're a useful asset in that location, and your employment history with this site makes you more than qualified. Please fully cooperate with Lambda-13 personnel when we come to investigate. Ms. Saunders: Of course, of course. Thanks, agent. Agent Fredericks: Thank you. Meg Saunders has been instructed to avoid the use of the SCP-2738-affected register in the store, as well as to monitor digital inventory for any further anomalies. West End Used Books' delivery driver was contacted and briefly interviewed, but did not report delivery of any of the products discussed by Ms. Saunders."

As tests have shown that SCP-2738 is potentially spread between registers and between retailers through the use of items anomalously transacted using the SCP-2738 program, such as prepaid cards or gift cards, a cover story of SCP-2738 being a credit theft program has been fully developed and spread to the upper management of all major US retailers.",
