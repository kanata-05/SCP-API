MTF ETA-62 \"White Noise\" has been established as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, with a mission to quickly locate and limit SCP-3234\u2019s spread through the general populace.\n1\n\n\nOnce contained, instances of SCP-3234-1 are to be monitored for signs of the final stages of SCP-3234. If an instance is found to be in the later stages, protocol is immediate termination. Instances of SCP-3234-1 found early enough are to maintain sessions with a Foundation therapist three times a week, or as mandated by the Site Director, with follow up tests performed by a psychiatrist. Instances are under no circumstances to be exposed to negative stimuli.\n\n\nIf an instance of SCP-3234-1 has recovered from the effects of SCP-3234, they are to be administered a Class-A amnestic and reintroduced to the general population with an appropriate cover story as per standard protocols. Foundation personnel are then to be stationed in the vicinity of multiple SCP-3234-1 instances, to ease further monitoring. They are to maintain these positions until the predicted chance of a resurgence of SCP-3234 is minimal.\n\n\n\n\nI want to be very clear with the protocols put into place to surveil the instances of SCP-3234-1. This is not a babysitting position, and it does not give agents tasked with observation the ability to disregard their other responsibilities. This position is to maintain a regular surveillance presence in case there is a relapse. At this time it\u2019s not a realistic solution to keep the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 affected individuals in on-site containment, and I will not entertain the notion of terminating them. If you find yourself on this assignment, consider it like any other surveillance operation. You watch, and you report if there are any abnormalities in behaviour. The only difference is proximity to your target.\n \u2013 Dr. Vaile\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription:\n SCP-3234 is an anomalous instance of a dissociative disorder that affects individuals with a highly negative sense of self, who desire to cease interactions with society. SCP-3234-1 is the designation for any subject affected by SCP-3234. Severity of SCP-3234 symptoms are directly proportional to the intensity of SCP-3234-1's stressful or negative thoughts.\n\n\nSymptoms of SCP-3234 surface as a diminished memory and the sensation of losing time. SCP-3234-1\u2018s ability to communicate is heavily impaired due to an inability to grasp thoughts accurately, causing unconventional speech patterns and the repetition of phrases. [A detailed example is shown within the attached document \u201cSubject 1A session log-1\u201d.]\n\n\nIn advanced stages of SCP-3234, Subjects affected by SCP-3234 will gradually become covered in a visual effect that resembles video noise. An instance of SCP-3234 will start to see their surroundings as dim and monochromatic, even if there are ample sources of light in the area. Instances will exhibit a similar case of colourlessness as they become grey and lose any defining features.\n\n\nThe visual noise first occurs in the eyes, and then gradually spreads across the subject\u2019s body. SCP-3234-1\u2019s body begins to be replaced by the visual noise approximately twenty-seven hours after SCP-3234-1 is fully covered. Instances do not respond to stimuli at this point, and the process is thought to be non-painful. Once the visual noise has completely engulfed SCP-3234-1, the subject will dissipate.\n\n\n\n\nAs many of you reading this are well aware, previous attempts at understanding and halting the progression of SCP-3234 have proven fruitless. I was shocked at the level of carelessness in the handling of \nprevious SCP-3234-1 subjects\n. So far we\u2019ve had \u2588\u2588\u2588 subjects become unrecoverable. This is an unacceptable amount given the information we should be using to halt their progression. So, as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, I have taken up the responsibility of figuring out the best course of action to take, and so far these efforts have proven enlightening. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of adding some of the sessions with a typical subject with SCP-3234 in Dr. Welligo's examination. My hope is to provide a basis for how the treatment of these instances should be handled in the future. \u2013 Dr. Vaile\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddendum-3234-A: Subject retrieval and examination.\n\n\nSCP-3234-1A was brought to the attention of Foundation personnel when civilians of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Oregon had reported sightings of a grey skinned humanoid inside an apartment complex. MTF ETA-62 was dispatched for containment. 1A was found, though showed no response to the agent\u2019s entrance.\n\n\nInitial interactions consisted of garbled and incoherent speech from 1A. 1A had significant progression of SCP-3234\u2019s physical symptoms. A cursory search of the apartment indicated that 1A had been dealing with SCP-3234 for an extended period of time.\n\n\n1A showed no resistance to transportation to Site-\u2588\u2588. During transport, agents described 1A as becoming more coherent through consistent conversation. Between the time of retrieval and the subsequent containment of 1A, the progression of SCP-3234 had lessened to the degree that Dr. Vaile could communicate with it. 1A had so far complied with the treatment plan with little reservation. 1A was sent to Dr. Welligo for examination.\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Elijah \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\nDesignation:\n Subject 3234-1A\n\n\nAge:\n Twenty-eight\n\n\nSex:\n Male\n\n\nSCP-3234 progression:\n\nSCP-3234-1A exhibited symptoms common to early-middle stages of SCP-3234.\n\n\nInitial symptoms of SCP-3234:\n\nSkin, irises and hair have small amounts of coloration remaining, with the majority being grey. SCP-3234-1A does not remember how long they have been experiencing these effects. Despite their memory impairments, they have been able to retain the knowledge that they are undergoing treatment for a mental illness. 1A has also exhibited an impairment of verbalising his thoughts, to the point of slurred and repetitive speech.\n\n\nTreatment:\n\nThree therapy sessions weekly with a qualified Foundation therapist, with weekly follow up tests by either me or another qualified psychiatrist.\n\n\nCurrent status:\n\nSCP-3234-1A has complied with the therapy regiment. As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 signs of SCP-3234 effects have lessened significantly. Pending final evaluations, 1A is to be administered a class-A amnestic and returned to the general population with undercover surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-1\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-1\n\n\n\n\nSubject 1A session log-1\n\n\nTherapist:\n Dr. Vaile\n\n\nForward:\n First meeting with Elijah since retrieval. Adjustments to his new environment, particularly periods of isolation in containment, seem to have aggravated the symptoms of SCP-3234. Despite this, he remains co-operative with ongoing treatment.\n\n\n<Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]>\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Hello Elijah, are you feeling better now?\n\n\nElijah:\n I think I can talk now. I don\u2019t know about the feeling better part though.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Why is that, Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n Well\u2026Is, is this normal?\n\n\n[Elijah scratches his arm, small flickers of visual noise are visible on his skin.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n For the illness that you have, yes. It means that it\u2019s progressing. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that right now, you just started treatment, right?\n\n\nElijah:\n I guess so yeah, I\u2026 wanna get better.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I\u2019d like to see you get better too, how about we start with talking about how you\u2019re doing right now, what\u2019s on your mind?\n\n\nElijah:\n On my mind? A lot of things. It\u2019s all a bit\u2026 it\u2019s a bit overwhelming, trying to put everything into place in my head. I woke up and forgot that I was here.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n And that happens often, right? The forgetting part.\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah, well it\u2019s not really forgetting I guess. It\u2019s more like, I have to try to put it together, if that makes sense? I remember this place, I remember a lot of things but it just feels\u2026 distant. Like I was here, but when I was here is another story. It\u2019s, I guess, Hard to explain.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I can get a pretty good idea, Elijah, of what you\u2019re going through. What thoughts that you\u2019re having may be causing issues?\n\n\nElijah:\n Oh , yeah. It\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s stupid. I don\u2019t even know why I can\u2019t shake it out of my head. Everything else feels like a broken puzzle but certain things\u2026 They stick out, you know? It\u2019s like, they\u2019re sharp when everything else is muddy and dull.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n And what are those thoughts?\n\n\nElijah:\n Laura. I remember Laura. Pieces, like a name. I remember hating myself but I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know, I just can\u2019t remember much.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Who is Laura?\n\n\n[Elijah rests his head on his palm. He breaks eye contact with Dr. Vaile for an extended period before continuing.]\n\n\nElijah:\n Laura is my sister. Well, no that\u2019s not right. We grew up together. She lived next door, I remember that really clearly, I think. She would always come over, basically my sister.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n What is it about Laura that sticks out so clearly to you?\n\n\nElijah:\n Just\u2026 Her, I guess? It\u2019s getting\u2026getting hard to remember her face though. The more I think about her the blurrier the memories get. Like they\u2019re moving away from me? I just, I don\u2019t understand. I can feel this weight and her name but that\u2019s, that\u2019s all I can remember.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n With your illness, memories might not come as easily to you. It\u2019s alright, just tell me what you do remember.\n\n\nElijah:\n I remember her smile, I think I do at least. Everything else is white. It feels like a dream and it\u2019s just her smiling. It\u2019s a shock when I try to think of her. Like, that jolt you get when you wake up from a nightmare. I know something\u2019s wrong but she\u2019s, she\u2019s smiling and I\u2019m not sure why I don\u2019t like it. There\u2019s something missing now that was there before. I can\u2019t remember anything else, God why can\u2019t I remember?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n It\u2019s the illness, AI, it\u2019s going to be hard to remember things.\n\n\nElijah:\n Just the illness? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve dealt with this\u2026 for a long time and it just, I don\u2019t know why I hate this feeling. I don\u2019t want to remember anymore. How long have we been talking about this? Is it time for me to go yet?\n\n\n[Elijah appears to be crying, although no facial indicators of sadness other than watering of the eyes are visible.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n That\u2019s all right, It\u2019s all right Elijah. We\u2019ve only been talking about this for a short time, why don\u2019t we talk about something else? What\u2019s something you do want to talk about then?\n\n\nElijah:\n something I do want to talk about? I uh\u2026 can I get more lights. In my room I mean, it\u2019s pretty dark. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s all I can think of right now.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n It\u2019s dark in your room?\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah, well it\u2019s dark everywhere really. When I first got here it wasn\u2019t this dark, maybe the lights are dimming or something.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I\u2019ll look into that, Elijah. And I want to say that I\u2019m glad you\u2019re opening up about this. I want to help you, Elijah, Help you through this.\n\n\nElijah:\n Thanks\u2026 It\u2019s just hard to\u2026 to do much right now. I feel like my energy is being sucked out of me every time I try to think about anything solid. It\u2019s like grasping at air, it takes a lot of effort. I just don\u2019t know if I have that much effort to give.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Well I think that\u2019s a sign that the illness hasn\u2019t completely taken over. You\u2019re fighting, and that\u2019s good. I\u2019m alright with ending this session here if that\u2019s what you want to do.\n\n\nElijah:\n Thanks, yeah I think that\u2019s a good idea.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n And remember, if you need anything my office is open for you. Just keep trying, I\u2019ll help you fight this as long as you can promise me you\u2019ll try too.\n\n\nElijah:\n I will. And yeah, I might take you up on that\u2026 It gets\u2026 bad, sitting around, being like\u2026like this for reasons I don\u2019t even know.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I hope you do.\n\n\n[Session one ends early, Dr. Vaile leads Elijah out of the office.]\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-2\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-2\n\n\n\n\nSubject 1A session log-2\n\n\nTherapist:\n Dr. Vaile\n\n\nForward:\nElijah came for a session earlier than scheduled. Physical signs of SCP-3234 are more visible than before. His mental state appears less stable than previous sessions.\n\n\n<Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]>\n\n\nElijah:\n Hey, Doctor Vaile. I wanted to uh, talk to you if this is a good time?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Of course, like I said in our last session, if you wanted to talk about something my door is always open.\n\n\nElijah:\n Thanks yeah I uh\u2026 I just wanted to get some thoughts out, see if you could\u2026 make sense of them? I don\u2019t know why but those memories we talked about before, I can\u2019t get them out of my mind. It\u2019s like when I close my eyes it\u2019s all I can see. Before, it hurt to even try to remember them. I shut them out and just sat on my own, letting the world go by while I stayed still. I still feel that\u2026 that stagnation, but now, well\u2026 it still hurts but I want to try? I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Of course, Elijah. We can talk about anything you want to, what about that memory have you been thinking of?\n\n\nElijah:\n I think I know why I\u2019ve been feeling so down lately. I can\u2019t really put my finger on it, and it\u2019s not exactly about the memory. It\u2019s more about, how do I explain this? It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been thinking of\u2026 thinking of thinking about it? I don\u2019t know how to like, express that but yeah.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n What about that did you want to get off your chest?\n\n\nElijah:\n Like, I think I\u2019ve been feeling down because of something, right? There has to be\u2026 there has to be a reason why I\u2019m feeling so shitty about myself. Like the only time I can think clearly is when I\u2019m hurting, when I remember\u2026Laura. Laura and her smile, and the\u2026 the feeling of being isolated I don\u2019t quite understand.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n So you think that that memory has something to do with your illness?\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah, I guess yes. I remember\u2026 not being like this. I didn\u2019t feel\u2026drained, When I was with Laura. I want to piece it together but I don\u2019t know how. Sitting in that room\u2026 Just thinking and spinning in my own head and the only thought I can grasp that doesn\u2019t fade out of sight is that one.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n That\u2019s a good sign, Elijah. Talking about this seems to be stirring your mind in the right direction. Does it still feel like a broken puzzle now? I remember you talking about not remembering more than her smile, has that changed since we last talked?\n\n\nElijah:\n It\u2019s sort of still a broken puzzle. Like, I hear sounds that don\u2019t fit and I remember colours that I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I remember them. But it\u2019s like something is there, and if I just\u2026just keep talking it might get clearer for me.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n That\u2019s another good sign. I think I might be getting an idea as to what may be the root of this, segmentation of your memories. I\u2019d like to hear more about Laura, I know last time it was a tough subject but I\u2019m hoping that you feel like we can power through that together. What do you think?\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah, Yes I want to. Well, I think that\u2019s not quite right actually. I don\u2019t want to, but I feel like I need to? Like somethings stuck in my throat, waiting to get out.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Whenever you feel ready, I\u2019m here to listen.\n\n\n[Dr. Vaile takes a box of tissues off of the table and places it in front of Elijah.]\n\n\nElijah:\n Alright. I think\u2026Yeah I\u2019m ready. So, what I\u2019ve put together so far\u2026 the last time I saw her. No that\u2019s\u2026 No that\u2019s not quite right I think, it wasn\u2019t the last time? I think it was one of the last times I saw her. I remember being with her and watching her look over at me with that smile. It still\u2026goes white after that but I remember that I was with her. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right, either, but it feels like it makes sense.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n And that\u2019s when the pain comes back, right Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah. And the bright flash of colours, and the loud sounds\u2026They all come around then but I can\u2019t put it together. It\u2019s like I have all of these things that should fit but I just can\u2019t see how they connect.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I have a question about that. I have a feeling that it might\u2026 \n[Dr. Vaile pauses briefly.]\n It might not be that you can\u2019t put them together. I just wanted to know if it\u2019s possible that you instead are forcing yourself to, not put it together. I get the feeling that there might be some part of you wants you to not remember. Does that make sense to you?\n\n\nElijah:\n I\u2026 \n[Elijah pauses, looking down at his feet momentarily before gathering his composure.]\n \u2026You think so? That I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m holding it back?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I think that might be the case, not consciously, but you could be internalising it to the point that it\u2019s effecting you on a large scale. Does that sound like it might be correct, Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n I think\u2026 I think it might be. But, I don\u2019t understand. Because, I want to remember, right? I\u2019m trying and\u2026not remembering is dull\u2026 and remembering is painful. Why would I, why would my brain do that?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n That, Elijah, is what I think we should focus on finding out. I think whatever it is that you\u2019ve been keeping deep down is the cause of this Illness.\n\n\n[Elijah crosses his arms on his lap and lays his head down. Crying can be heard from him as Dr. Vaile leans in.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n \n[There\u2019s a silence of 20 seconds before the Dr. Vaile speaks]\n Elijah? Are you with me?\n\n\nElijah:\n I can\u2019t\u2026 it hurts so bad I want it to just stop. I don\u2019t know what to do. I try to be strong, I try to think and think and it just keeps coming up blank. God, her smile\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 Why does remembering her smile make me feel so alone? It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s digging into my stomach and I don\u2019t know what to do. Before, everything was a haze and I forgot\u2026 I missed days and weeks at a time. Everything was the same, everything blended together and I didn\u2019t feel\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel a thing.\n\n\n[Elijah pauses, still audibly crying. He sits back up, places his hands over his eyes and laughs.]\n\n\nElijah:\n But now it just hurts. It\u2019s more painful. I forget how long I\u2019ve been in this\u2026place. I forget things about who I am. I feel like I\u2019m breaking. I feel like I\u2019m waving in this gust of wind and being split apart. Then I see her\u2026 her smiling and then my chest aches. I feel so\u2026 lost. When I try to remember why\u2026 When I try to remember anything after her smile I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how long I forgot about her. I\u2019m missing\u2026 I\u2019m missing so much and I\u2019m having trouble expressing that emptiness.\n\n\n[Dr. Vaile puts her hand on Elijah\u2019s shoulder.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Elijah, I want you to listen to me, okay? What you just told me\u2026 that was the strongest reaction you\u2019ve shown yet. It may hurt, but I think as long as we try to avoid that pain it\u2019ll keep getting stronger. You\u2019re strong, Elijah. I want to help you face that pain and overcome it, and I think you can.\n\n\nElijah:\n I\u2026I want to\u2026 Laura was my best friend. But why did I forget her face for so long? And why does it hurt to remember it? It\u2019s like I\u2019m being woken up before the end of a dream.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I want to find out with you. Let\u2019s end this session here, and come back to this next week. I\u2019m very proud of the progress you\u2019ve made so far. You\u2019ve opened up so much, and I can feel us getting closer to the source of this frustration for you.\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really tired right now. I need some time to try to\u2026 to try to piece this together.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Of course, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, to help you get through this. It will be tough, Elijah, but I know you can pull through this.\n\n\nElijah:\n Thanks, I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m going to go get some rest.\n\n\n< End Log>\n\n\nNote:\n \nI think this is an important turning point in Elijah\u2019s treatment. The more I can get him to open up, the closer I believe we are to understanding what has caused his dissociative state. If we can pinpoint the memory that Elijah is suppressing we can unlock that lost time, and hopefully the other pieces will fall into place. Causing Elijah to come to terms and work through that is the next step. I don\u2019t know if effects from SCP-3234 will become worse at that point, but it\u2019s a definite possibility. \u2013Dr. Vaile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0Dr.Welligo\u00a0evaluation\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0Dr.Welligo\u00a0evaluation\n\n\n\n\nBefore the third session with 1A, they were found in their room, there was significant visual noise present on their face and torso. 1A was immediately brought in for examination at this point. Their eyes had shown slight amounts of visual noise, which was a major concern that 1A was devolving into the final stages. Dr. Vaile had tried to converse with 1A, though their ability to communicate had deteriorated significantly. The loss of time, fragmented memories and a general unfocused thinking pattern have intensified. I\u2019ve been informed by Dr. Vaile that this isn\u2019t necessarily a worst case scenario and I\u2019ll defer to her judgement in regards to treatment. \u2013Dr.Welligo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-3\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-3\n\n\n\n\nSubject 1A session log-3\n\n\nTherapist:\n Dr. Vaile\n\n\nForward:\n Elijah\u2019s symptoms have become increasingly agitated. This session is a critical point in determining the effectiveness of therapy as a means to halt and reverse SCP-3234. While the risk is still severe, attempting to reverse the symptoms from this point onward could lead to discovering the cause of Elijah\u2019s disassociation.\n\n\nElijah\u2019s speech was heavily impaired.

The sound of white noise can be heard during this.]\n Why am I here?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n You\u2019re here because you\u2019re sick, Elijah. Do you remember, coming here for treatment?\n\n\nElijah:\n You sound weird. \nEverything\n sounds a bit \nweird\n right now.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n How do I sound to you?\n\n\nElijah:\n Like you\u2019re \nyelling\n down a well. Why do I \nhave\n to be here?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Like I said before Elijah, you\u2019re here for treatment.\n\n\nElijah:\n You said before? \n[Elijah pauses, eyes flicker with visual noise before taking a heavy breath.]\n Why am I \nhere\n?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n \n[Dr. Vaile is quiet for a moment before leaning closer to Elijah.]\n Where is here, Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n Here? I was at \nhome\n a second ago. Wasn\u2019t I? \nI don\u2019t want to be there\n, either. Or am I at home right now\u2026 where am I?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n \n[Dr. Vaile puts her hands on the sides of Elijah\u2019s head and moves his head to force eye contact.]\n Treatment.\n\n\nElijah:\n Treatment? \nI thought that was a dream\n. Your face, I can\u2019t put your face it together. \nDo I know you?\n I can\u2019t remember your face, I keep seeing faces in my mind and I can\u2019t find their names. It\u2019s hard to see. Everything\u2019s so \ndark\n I might know your face, but I can\u2019t tell.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n What\u2019s the last thing you remember?\n\n\nElijah:\n The last thing \nI remember?\n It all feels so far away. \nI don\u2019t feel like\n\u2026 going after them.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Going after what?\n\n\nElijah:\n \nAnything\n. It\u2019s all drifting out of reach. I tried chasing them for so long. It\u2019s \nempty\n now.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Doctor Vaile. Repeat after me. \n[Elijah tries to move out of eye contact, Dr. Vaile doesn\u2019t let go.]\n\n\nElijah:\n Doctor\u2026 Vaile?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n My name, is Doctor Vaile. You are here for treatment.\n\n\nElijah:\n Your name is Doctor Vaile. I\u2019m here\u2026 \n[A brief flicker of visual noise crosses Elijah\u2019s eyes before he begins looking around with a confused expression.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n \u2026For treatment.\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah. I can remember it now. \n[Elijah lowers his head into his hands. Heavy breathing can be heard.]]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n What happened to you Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n I don\u2019t know. I went away. I felt like I was floating for a while. Too much thinking. I didn\u2019t feel like, like myself. It felt like needles.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Are you okay now, Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah, I think I\u2019m\u2026 okay right now \n[Elijah appears to be half awake at this point.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Just remember to keep looking forward. Each day is a new day, it'll get better.\n\n\nElijah:\n I\u2019ve never been very good at looking forward. I shoulda watched\u2026 shoulda kept my eyes off you\u2026 \n[Elijah is assumed to fall asleep due to exhaustion.]\n\n\n[Dr. Vaile sat in silence for a few minutes before helping Elijah back to his room.]\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\nNotes: \nElijah was monitored for another agitation of SCP-3234 following this session.

The goal of this session will revolve around unpacking the memories of Laura.\n\n\n<Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]>\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Alright, Elijah are you ready for today?\n\n\nElijah:\n I think so\u2026\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n You seem to have had some issues while you were alone. The first thing I\u2019d like to know is what happened then?\n\n\nElijah:\n I\u2026 I tried to remember as much as I could. I kept forcing it and eventually it was\u2026 just really painful. I just\u2026 I started to get the feeling that I should just stop trying. I just laid there and I could feel my mind going blank. I felt this\u2026 tingling and then I went numb. It was like a dream, I was looking up and I could feel the walls coming in. I could feel that but, I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t care? It felt like I was falling, it didn\u2019t feel real. I forget how long I was like that before someone found me. But\u2026I guess I got better, right?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n It looks like you did. What do you think stopped you from thinking further?\n\n\nElijah:\n I\u2019m not sure. I felt like I was pushing against my own brain. I couldn\u2019t overpower it. It sucked me in and I just kept falling.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Well, I want to try to dig deeper now. I\u2019ll be here to stop you if you start to feel numb again. I believe you got close then, closer than we have so far. If we push just a little bit more, I think we can find the trigger for your illness Elijah. Do you feel comfortable trying?\n\n\nElijah:\n I think so, what do you want me to do?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Just lay down, Elijah. I want you to close your eyes and think of Laura.\n\n\n[Elijah lays down and closes his eyes. Dr. Vaile leans forward slightly. A few seconds pass before Elijah starts to speak.]\n\n\nElijah:\n I see her\u2026 Laura looking at me. This is when I started feeling sick. I feel it right in my stomach. God It\u2019s churning, somethings spinning it doesn\u2019t feel right. \n[Elijah grabs his stomach and winces.]\n Why am\u2026 I remember why I feel this\u2026 why was I looking at her? I shouldn\u2019t have been\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have looked at her. Shit. Shit. It feels\u2026It feels like it\u2019s going faster. My head feels like it\u2019s cracking.\n\n\n[Elijah grabs the sides of his head and squeezes tightly. he sighs and holds his eyes closed tightly. Dr. Vaile puts her hand on his shoulder.]\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n That\u2019s good, Elijah. That\u2019s good. Tell me, what is going faster? Why don\u2019t you think you should be looking at her?\n\n\nElijah:\n The car.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n The car?\n\n\nElijah:\n I was\u2026 I was driving, why was I looking at her? I don\u2019t understand. I see it, the bright light behind her smile. It was sunny out. It was so\u2026 so damn bright it hurt my eyes. I wasn\u2019t looking at the road, why was I looking at her? I see it\u2026 I\u2026 Dammit I saw it coming. I winced and I missed it. I remember her smile. I remember it so clearly and then just a flash.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n You were in a car crash, Elijah. Is that what happened?\n\n\nElijah:\n Yeah\u2026 I took my eyes off the road for a second. That\u2026 \n[Elijah hits his chest.]\n One second that\u2026 felt like forever.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Elijah, It wasn\u2019t your fault. Elijah, I need you to realise it wasn\u2019t your fault.\n\n\n*\n[Elijah begins to tear up. Gasping noises and shallow breathes can be heard coming from him.]\n\n\nElijah:\n It was my fault. I didn\u2019t\u2026 I remember now. After that, when I woke up and saw what had happened it froze\u2026 it all froze. That\u2026 [Elijah motions his hand over his chest.] That pang in my heart started. I don\u2019t remember how I got home. I don\u2019t remember what I did for\u2026 what feels like a lifetime after.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n You shut yourself off, is this when it started? The illness?\n\n\nElijah:\n I think so. I remember the colour draining out of everything. That much I can put together. I didn\u2019t want to do anything. I wanted to forget, I think. I don\u2019t know why, I should have remembered. I think\u2026 I think I missed her funeral. I don\u2019t remember going. I shut it all out and\u2026 I lost the chance to remember her.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I know this is hard for you Elijah. I know you\u2019ve been holding this in for a long time. But I also know how strong you are, Elijah. You can confront this, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\n\n\n[Elijah begins to laugh, while still crying heavily.]\n\n\nElijah:\n God dammit. What I would give, right now to feel numb. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t stop this pain. It was easier to\u2026 it was easier to forget. It\u2026 \n[Stammering through heavy inhales can be heard.]\n hurts and I can\u2019t shut it out.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n Don\u2019t try to shut it out again, Elijah. You are strong, you can face this. You can remember, and keep remembering. Don\u2019t forget Laura, she wouldn\u2019t want you to forget her, would she Elijah?\n\n\nElijah:\n No, no she wouldn\u2019t. That smile\u2026 is the last time I saw her alive. I made a mistake and\u2026 Do you think she would forgive me? If she was looking down on me right now, could she forgive me?\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I think so, Elijah. I also think, you can forgive yourself. I think you did great today.\n\n\nElijah:\n I think I need to be alone for a bit. I need time to\u2026think.\n\n\nDr. Vaile:\n I understand. I\u2019m glad you were able to remember her, Elijah. I think this is a great step towards overcoming this illness.\n\n\nElijah:\n I hope so.\n\n\n[Elijah spent a few minutes composing himself before leaving the office.]\n\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\u00a0Open\u00a0continuation\u00a0of\u00a0treatment\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0Close\u00a0continuation\u00a0of\u00a0treatment\n\n\n\n\nThe treatment for SCP-3234 in Elijah has so far been a success. After our breakthrough in session four, I was able to get Elijah to open up further. The sessions directly following have shown Elijah to be in a significantly better mental state than at the beginning of treatment. It is my suggestion that Elijah be considered for return to the general population. A Class-A amnestic should be administered. The cover story should be significant therapy sessions about the traumatic experience he had been through that caused disassociation and depression within Elijah. An agent is to be placed in Elijah\u2019s life to act as a friend, to help lessen the chance of a possible relapse. It\u2019s currently believed that Elijah is in complete remission from SCP-3234\u2019s effects and should not be deemed a threat. \u2013Dr. Vaile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n1\n.

        "Addendum-3234-A: Subject retrieval and examination.\nSCP-3234-1A was brought to the attention of Foundation personnel when civilians of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Oregon had reported sightings of a grey skinned humanoid inside an apartment complex. MTF ETA-62 was dispatched for containment. 1A was found, though showed no response to the agent\u2019s entrance.\nInitial interactions consisted of garbled and incoherent speech from 1A. 1A had significant progression of SCP-3234\u2019s physical symptoms. A cursory search of the apartment indicated that 1A had been dealing with SCP-3234 for an extended period of time.\n1A showed no resistance to transportation to Site-\u2588\u2588. During transport, agents described 1A as becoming more coherent through consistent conversation. Between the time of retrieval and the subsequent containment of 1A, the progression of SCP-3234 had lessened to the degree that Dr. Vaile could communicate with it. 1A had so far complied with the treatment plan with little reservation. 1A was sent to Dr. Welligo for examination."

        "I want to be very clear with the protocols put into place to surveil the instances of SCP-3234-1. This is not a babysitting position, and it does not give agents tasked with observation the ability to disregard their other responsibilities. This position is to maintain a regular surveillance presence in case there is a relapse. At this time it\u2019s not a realistic solution to keep the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 affected individuals in on-site containment, and I will not entertain the notion of terminating them. If you find yourself on this assignment, consider it like any other surveillance operation. You watch, and you report if there are any abnormalities in behaviour. The only difference is proximity to your target. \u2013 Dr. Vaile",
        "As many of you reading this are well aware, previous attempts at understanding and halting the progression of SCP-3234 have proven fruitless. I was shocked at the level of carelessness in the handling of previous SCP-3234-1 subjects . So far we\u2019ve had \u2588\u2588\u2588 subjects become unrecoverable. This is an unacceptable amount given the information we should be using to halt their progression. So, as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, I have taken up the responsibility of figuring out the best course of action to take, and so far these efforts have proven enlightening. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of adding some of the sessions with a typical subject with SCP-3234 in Dr. Welligo's examination. My hope is to provide a basis for how the treatment of these instances should be handled in the future. \u2013 Dr. Vaile",
        "Name: Elijah \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Designation: Subject 3234-1A Age: Twenty-eight Sex: Male SCP-3234 progression: SCP-3234-1A exhibited symptoms common to early-middle stages of SCP-3234. Initial symptoms of SCP-3234: Skin, irises and hair have small amounts of coloration remaining, with the majority being grey. SCP-3234-1A does not remember how long they have been experiencing these effects. Despite their memory impairments, they have been able to retain the knowledge that they are undergoing treatment for a mental illness. 1A has also exhibited an impairment of verbalising his thoughts, to the point of slurred and repetitive speech. Treatment: Three therapy sessions weekly with a qualified Foundation therapist, with weekly follow up tests by either me or another qualified psychiatrist. Current status: SCP-3234-1A has complied with the therapy regiment. As of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588 signs of SCP-3234 effects have lessened significantly. Pending final evaluations, 1A is to be administered a class-A amnestic and returned to the general population with undercover surveillance. +\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-1 -\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-1 Subject 1A session log-1 Therapist: Dr. Vaile Forward: First meeting with Elijah since retrieval. Adjustments to his new environment, particularly periods of isolation in containment, seem to have aggravated the symptoms of SCP-3234. Despite this, he remains co-operative with ongoing treatment. <Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]> Dr. Vaile: Hello Elijah, are you feeling better now? Elijah: I think I can talk now. I don\u2019t know about the feeling better part though. Dr. Vaile: Why is that, Elijah? Elijah: Well\u2026Is, is this normal? [Elijah scratches his arm, small flickers of visual noise are visible on his skin.] Dr. Vaile: For the illness that you have, yes. It means that it\u2019s progressing. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that right now, you just started treatment, right? Elijah: I guess so yeah, I\u2026 wanna get better. Dr. Vaile: I\u2019d like to see you get better too, how about we start with talking about how you\u2019re doing right now, what\u2019s on your mind? Elijah: On my mind? A lot of things. It\u2019s all a bit\u2026 it\u2019s a bit overwhelming, trying to put everything into place in my head. I woke up and forgot that I was here. Dr. Vaile: And that happens often, right? The forgetting part. Elijah: Yeah, well it\u2019s not really forgetting I guess. It\u2019s more like, I have to try to put it together, if that makes sense? I remember this place, I remember a lot of things but it just feels\u2026 distant. Like I was here, but when I was here is another story. It\u2019s, I guess, Hard to explain. Dr. Vaile: I can get a pretty good idea, Elijah, of what you\u2019re going through. What thoughts that you\u2019re having may be causing issues? Elijah: Oh , yeah. It\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s stupid. I don\u2019t even know why I can\u2019t shake it out of my head. Everything else feels like a broken puzzle but certain things\u2026 They stick out, you know? It\u2019s like, they\u2019re sharp when everything else is muddy and dull. Dr. Vaile: And what are those thoughts? Elijah: Laura. I remember Laura. Pieces, like a name. I remember hating myself but I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know, I just can\u2019t remember much. Dr. Vaile: Who is Laura? [Elijah rests his head on his palm. He breaks eye contact with Dr. Vaile for an extended period before continuing.] Elijah: Laura is my sister. Well, no that\u2019s not right. We grew up together. She lived next door, I remember that really clearly, I think. She would always come over, basically my sister. Dr. Vaile: What is it about Laura that sticks out so clearly to you? Elijah: Just\u2026 Her, I guess? It\u2019s getting\u2026getting hard to remember her face though. The more I think about her the blurrier the memories get. Like they\u2019re moving away from me? I just, I don\u2019t understand. I can feel this weight and her name but that\u2019s, that\u2019s all I can remember. Dr. Vaile: With your illness, memories might not come as easily to you. It\u2019s alright, just tell me what you do remember. Elijah: I remember her smile, I think I do at least. Everything else is white. It feels like a dream and it\u2019s just her smiling. It\u2019s a shock when I try to think of her. Like, that jolt you get when you wake up from a nightmare. I know something\u2019s wrong but she\u2019s, she\u2019s smiling and I\u2019m not sure why I don\u2019t like it. There\u2019s something missing now that was there before. I can\u2019t remember anything else, God why can\u2019t I remember? Dr. Vaile: It\u2019s the illness, AI, it\u2019s going to be hard to remember things. Elijah: Just the illness? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve dealt with this\u2026 for a long time and it just, I don\u2019t know why I hate this feeling. I don\u2019t want to remember anymore. How long have we been talking about this? Is it time for me to go yet? [Elijah appears to be crying, although no facial indicators of sadness other than watering of the eyes are visible.] Dr. Vaile: That\u2019s all right, It\u2019s all right Elijah. We\u2019ve only been talking about this for a short time, why don\u2019t we talk about something else? What\u2019s something you do want to talk about then? Elijah: something I do want to talk about? I uh\u2026 can I get more lights. In my room I mean, it\u2019s pretty dark. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s all I can think of right now. Dr. Vaile: It\u2019s dark in your room? Elijah: Yeah, well it\u2019s dark everywhere really. When I first got here it wasn\u2019t this dark, maybe the lights are dimming or something. Dr. Vaile: I\u2019ll look into that, Elijah. And I want to say that I\u2019m glad you\u2019re opening up about this. I want to help you, Elijah, Help you through this. Elijah: Thanks\u2026 It\u2019s just hard to\u2026 to do much right now. I feel like my energy is being sucked out of me every time I try to think about anything solid. It\u2019s like grasping at air, it takes a lot of effort. I just don\u2019t know if I have that much effort to give. Dr. Vaile: Well I think that\u2019s a sign that the illness hasn\u2019t completely taken over. You\u2019re fighting, and that\u2019s good. I\u2019m alright with ending this session here if that\u2019s what you want to do. Elijah: Thanks, yeah I think that\u2019s a good idea. Dr. Vaile: And remember, if you need anything my office is open for you. Just keep trying, I\u2019ll help you fight this as long as you can promise me you\u2019ll try too. Elijah: I will. And yeah, I might take you up on that\u2026 It gets\u2026 bad, sitting around, being like\u2026like this for reasons I don\u2019t even know. Dr. Vaile: I hope you do. [Session one ends early, Dr. Vaile leads Elijah out of the office.] <End Log> +\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-2 -\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-2 Subject 1A session log-2 Therapist: Dr. Vaile Forward: Elijah came for a session earlier than scheduled. Physical signs of SCP-3234 are more visible than before. His mental state appears less stable than previous sessions. <Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]> Elijah: Hey, Doctor Vaile. I wanted to uh, talk to you if this is a good time? Dr. Vaile: Of course, like I said in our last session, if you wanted to talk about something my door is always open. Elijah: Thanks yeah I uh\u2026 I just wanted to get some thoughts out, see if you could\u2026 make sense of them? I don\u2019t know why but those memories we talked about before, I can\u2019t get them out of my mind. It\u2019s like when I close my eyes it\u2019s all I can see. Before, it hurt to even try to remember them. I shut them out and just sat on my own, letting the world go by while I stayed still. I still feel that\u2026 that stagnation, but now, well\u2026 it still hurts but I want to try? I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Dr. Vaile: Of course, Elijah. We can talk about anything you want to, what about that memory have you been thinking of? Elijah: I think I know why I\u2019ve been feeling so down lately. I can\u2019t really put my finger on it, and it\u2019s not exactly about the memory. It\u2019s more about, how do I explain this? It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been thinking of\u2026 thinking of thinking about it? I don\u2019t know how to like, express that but yeah. Dr. Vaile: What about that did you want to get off your chest? Elijah: Like, I think I\u2019ve been feeling down because of something, right? There has to be\u2026 there has to be a reason why I\u2019m feeling so shitty about myself. Like the only time I can think clearly is when I\u2019m hurting, when I remember\u2026Laura. Laura and her smile, and the\u2026 the feeling of being isolated I don\u2019t quite understand. Dr. Vaile: So you think that that memory has something to do with your illness? Elijah: Yeah, I guess yes. I remember\u2026 not being like this. I didn\u2019t feel\u2026drained, When I was with Laura. I want to piece it together but I don\u2019t know how. Sitting in that room\u2026 Just thinking and spinning in my own head and the only thought I can grasp that doesn\u2019t fade out of sight is that one. Dr. Vaile: That\u2019s a good sign, Elijah. Talking about this seems to be stirring your mind in the right direction. Does it still feel like a broken puzzle now? I remember you talking about not remembering more than her smile, has that changed since we last talked? Elijah: It\u2019s sort of still a broken puzzle. Like, I hear sounds that don\u2019t fit and I remember colours that I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I remember them. But it\u2019s like something is there, and if I just\u2026just keep talking it might get clearer for me. Dr. Vaile: That\u2019s another good sign. I think I might be getting an idea as to what may be the root of this, segmentation of your memories. I\u2019d like to hear more about Laura, I know last time it was a tough subject but I\u2019m hoping that you feel like we can power through that together. What do you think? Elijah: Yeah, Yes I want to. Well, I think that\u2019s not quite right actually. I don\u2019t want to, but I feel like I need to? Like somethings stuck in my throat, waiting to get out. Dr. Vaile: Whenever you feel ready, I\u2019m here to listen. [Dr. Vaile takes a box of tissues off of the table and places it in front of Elijah.] Elijah: Alright. I think\u2026Yeah I\u2019m ready. So, what I\u2019ve put together so far\u2026 the last time I saw her. No that\u2019s\u2026 No that\u2019s not quite right I think, it wasn\u2019t the last time? I think it was one of the last times I saw her. I remember being with her and watching her look over at me with that smile. It still\u2026goes white after that but I remember that I was with her. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right, either, but it feels like it makes sense. Dr. Vaile: And that\u2019s when the pain comes back, right Elijah? Elijah: Yeah. And the bright flash of colours, and the loud sounds\u2026They all come around then but I can\u2019t put it together. It\u2019s like I have all of these things that should fit but I just can\u2019t see how they connect. Dr. Vaile: I have a question about that. I have a feeling that it might\u2026 [Dr. Vaile pauses briefly.] It might not be that you can\u2019t put them together. I just wanted to know if it\u2019s possible that you instead are forcing yourself to, not put it together. I get the feeling that there might be some part of you wants you to not remember. Does that make sense to you? Elijah: I\u2026 [Elijah pauses, looking down at his feet momentarily before gathering his composure.] \u2026You think so? That I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m holding it back? Dr. Vaile: I think that might be the case, not consciously, but you could be internalising it to the point that it\u2019s effecting you on a large scale. Does that sound like it might be correct, Elijah? Elijah: I think\u2026 I think it might be. But, I don\u2019t understand. Because, I want to remember, right? I\u2019m trying and\u2026not remembering is dull\u2026 and remembering is painful. Why would I, why would my brain do that? Dr. Vaile: That, Elijah, is what I think we should focus on finding out. I think whatever it is that you\u2019ve been keeping deep down is the cause of this Illness. [Elijah crosses his arms on his lap and lays his head down. Crying can be heard from him as Dr. Vaile leans in.] Dr. Vaile: [There\u2019s a silence of 20 seconds before the Dr. Vaile speaks] Elijah? Are you with me? Elijah: I can\u2019t\u2026 it hurts so bad I want it to just stop. I don\u2019t know what to do. I try to be strong, I try to think and think and it just keeps coming up blank. God, her smile\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 Why does remembering her smile make me feel so alone? It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s digging into my stomach and I don\u2019t know what to do. Before, everything was a haze and I forgot\u2026 I missed days and weeks at a time. Everything was the same, everything blended together and I didn\u2019t feel\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel a thing. [Elijah pauses, still audibly crying. He sits back up, places his hands over his eyes and laughs.] Elijah: But now it just hurts. It\u2019s more painful. I forget how long I\u2019ve been in this\u2026place. I forget things about who I am. I feel like I\u2019m breaking. I feel like I\u2019m waving in this gust of wind and being split apart. Then I see her\u2026 her smiling and then my chest aches. I feel so\u2026 lost. When I try to remember why\u2026 When I try to remember anything after her smile I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how long I forgot about her. I\u2019m missing\u2026 I\u2019m missing so much and I\u2019m having trouble expressing that emptiness. [Dr. Vaile puts her hand on Elijah\u2019s shoulder.] Dr. Vaile: Elijah, I want you to listen to me, okay? What you just told me\u2026 that was the strongest reaction you\u2019ve shown yet. It may hurt, but I think as long as we try to avoid that pain it\u2019ll keep getting stronger. You\u2019re strong, Elijah. I want to help you face that pain and overcome it, and I think you can. Elijah: I\u2026I want to\u2026 Laura was my best friend. But why did I forget her face for so long? And why does it hurt to remember it? It\u2019s like I\u2019m being woken up before the end of a dream. Dr. Vaile: I want to find out with you. Let\u2019s end this session here, and come back to this next week. I\u2019m very proud of the progress you\u2019ve made so far. You\u2019ve opened up so much, and I can feel us getting closer to the source of this frustration for you. Elijah: Yeah I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really tired right now. I need some time to try to\u2026 to try to piece this together. Dr. Vaile: Of course, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, to help you get through this. It will be tough, Elijah, but I know you can pull through this. Elijah: Thanks, I\u2019m uh\u2026 I\u2019m going to go get some rest. < End Log> Note: I think this is an important turning point in Elijah\u2019s treatment. The more I can get him to open up, the closer I believe we are to understanding what has caused his dissociative state. If we can pinpoint the memory that Elijah is suppressing we can unlock that lost time, and hopefully the other pieces will fall into place. Causing Elijah to come to terms and work through that is the next step. I don\u2019t know if effects from SCP-3234 will become worse at that point, but it\u2019s a definite possibility. \u2013Dr. Vaile +\u00a0Open\u00a0Dr.Welligo\u00a0evaluation -\u00a0Close\u00a0Dr.Welligo\u00a0evaluation Before the third session with 1A, they were found in their room, there was significant visual noise present on their face and torso. 1A was immediately brought in for examination at this point. Their eyes had shown slight amounts of visual noise, which was a major concern that 1A was devolving into the final stages. Dr. Vaile had tried to converse with 1A, though their ability to communicate had deteriorated significantly. The loss of time, fragmented memories and a general unfocused thinking pattern have intensified. I\u2019ve been informed by Dr. Vaile that this isn\u2019t necessarily a worst case scenario and I\u2019ll defer to her judgement in regards to treatment. \u2013Dr.Welligo +\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-3 -\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-3 Subject 1A session log-3 Therapist: Dr. Vaile Forward: Elijah\u2019s symptoms have become increasingly agitated. This session is a critical point in determining the effectiveness of therapy as a means to halt and reverse SCP-3234. While the risk is still severe, attempting to reverse the symptoms from this point onward could lead to discovering the cause of Elijah\u2019s disassociation. Elijah\u2019s speech was heavily impaired. Instances of voice distortion have been recorded and Elijah\u2019s intended speech will be denoted by italics. <Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]> Dr. Vaile: Elijah? Are you with me right now? Elijah: [No response. Elijah stares with a blank expression towards the ceiling.] Dr. Vaile: Elijah I need you to focus on me, Elijah? Can you hear my voice? Elijah: [Elijah clears his throat. The sound of white noise can be heard during this.] Why am I here? Dr. Vaile: You\u2019re here because you\u2019re sick, Elijah. Do you remember, coming here for treatment? Elijah: You sound weird. Everything sounds a bit weird right now. Dr. Vaile: How do I sound to you? Elijah: Like you\u2019re yelling down a well. Why do I have to be here? Dr. Vaile: Like I said before Elijah, you\u2019re here for treatment. Elijah: You said before? [Elijah pauses, eyes flicker with visual noise before taking a heavy breath.] Why am I here ? Dr. Vaile: [Dr. Vaile is quiet for a moment before leaning closer to Elijah.] Where is here, Elijah? Elijah: Here? I was at home a second ago. Wasn\u2019t I? I don\u2019t want to be there , either. Or am I at home right now\u2026 where am I? Dr. Vaile: [Dr. Vaile puts her hands on the sides of Elijah\u2019s head and moves his head to force eye contact.] Treatment. Elijah: Treatment? I thought that was a dream . Your face, I can\u2019t put your face it together. Do I know you? I can\u2019t remember your face, I keep seeing faces in my mind and I can\u2019t find their names. It\u2019s hard to see. Everything\u2019s so dark I might know your face, but I can\u2019t tell. Dr. Vaile: What\u2019s the last thing you remember? Elijah: The last thing I remember? It all feels so far away. I don\u2019t feel like \u2026 going after them. Dr. Vaile: Going after what? Elijah: Anything . It\u2019s all drifting out of reach. I tried chasing them for so long. It\u2019s empty now. Dr. Vaile: Doctor Vaile. Repeat after me. [Elijah tries to move out of eye contact, Dr. Vaile doesn\u2019t let go.] Elijah: Doctor\u2026 Vaile? Dr. Vaile: My name, is Doctor Vaile. You are here for treatment. Elijah: Your name is Doctor Vaile. I\u2019m here\u2026 [A brief flicker of visual noise crosses Elijah\u2019s eyes before he begins looking around with a confused expression.] Dr. Vaile: \u2026For treatment. Elijah: Yeah. I can remember it now. [Elijah lowers his head into his hands. Heavy breathing can be heard.]] Dr. Vaile: What happened to you Elijah? Elijah: I don\u2019t know. I went away. I felt like I was floating for a while. Too much thinking. I didn\u2019t feel like, like myself. It felt like needles. Dr. Vaile: Are you okay now, Elijah? Elijah: Yeah, I think I\u2019m\u2026 okay right now [Elijah appears to be half awake at this point.] Dr. Vaile: Just remember to keep looking forward. Each day is a new day, it'll get better. Elijah: I\u2019ve never been very good at looking forward. I shoulda watched\u2026 shoulda kept my eyes off you\u2026 [Elijah is assumed to fall asleep due to exhaustion.] [Dr. Vaile sat in silence for a few minutes before helping Elijah back to his room.] <End Log> Notes: Elijah was monitored for another agitation of SCP-3234 following this session. Symptoms had subsided following my intervention, returning Elijah to a non-critical state. The next session will tell us if this was a step towards a conclusion or a setback in SCP-3234 treatment. - Dr. Vaile. +\u00a0Open\u00a01A-Session-4 -\u00a0Close\u00a01A-Session-4 Subject 1A session log-4 Therapist: Dr. Vaile Forward: This is the fourth session with Elijah. The goal of this session will revolve around unpacking the memories of Laura. <Begin Log, [\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588]> Dr. Vaile: Alright, Elijah are you ready for today? Elijah: I think so\u2026 Dr. Vaile: You seem to have had some issues while you were alone. The first thing I\u2019d like to know is what happened then? Elijah: I\u2026 I tried to remember as much as I could. I kept forcing it and eventually it was\u2026 just really painful. I just\u2026 I started to get the feeling that I should just stop trying. I just laid there and I could feel my mind going blank. I felt this\u2026 tingling and then I went numb. It was like a dream, I was looking up and I could feel the walls coming in. I could feel that but, I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t care? It felt like I was falling, it didn\u2019t feel real. I forget how long I was like that before someone found me. But\u2026I guess I got better, right? Dr. Vaile: It looks like you did. What do you think stopped you from thinking further? Elijah: I\u2019m not sure. I felt like I was pushing against my own brain. I couldn\u2019t overpower it. It sucked me in and I just kept falling. Dr. Vaile: Well, I want to try to dig deeper now. I\u2019ll be here to stop you if you start to feel numb again. I believe you got close then, closer than we have so far. If we push just a little bit more, I think we can find the trigger for your illness Elijah. Do you feel comfortable trying? Elijah: I think so, what do you want me to do? Dr. Vaile: Just lay down, Elijah. I want you to close your eyes and think of Laura. [Elijah lays down and closes his eyes. Dr. Vaile leans forward slightly. A few seconds pass before Elijah starts to speak.] Elijah: I see her\u2026 Laura looking at me. This is when I started feeling sick. I feel it right in my stomach. God It\u2019s churning, somethings spinning it doesn\u2019t feel right. [Elijah grabs his stomach and winces.] Why am\u2026 I remember why I feel this\u2026 why was I looking at her? I shouldn\u2019t have been\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have looked at her. Shit. Shit. It feels\u2026It feels like it\u2019s going faster. My head feels like it\u2019s cracking. [Elijah grabs the sides of his head and squeezes tightly. he sighs and holds his eyes closed tightly. Dr. Vaile puts her hand on his shoulder.] Dr. Vaile: That\u2019s good, Elijah. That\u2019s good. Tell me, what is going faster? Why don\u2019t you think you should be looking at her? Elijah: The car. Dr. Vaile: The car? Elijah: I was\u2026 I was driving, why was I looking at her? I don\u2019t understand. I see it, the bright light behind her smile. It was sunny out. It was so\u2026 so damn bright it hurt my eyes. I wasn\u2019t looking at the road, why was I looking at her? I see it\u2026 I\u2026 Dammit I saw it coming. I winced and I missed it. I remember her smile. I remember it so clearly and then just a flash. Dr. Vaile: You were in a car crash, Elijah. Is that what happened? Elijah: Yeah\u2026 I took my eyes off the road for a second. That\u2026 [Elijah hits his chest.] One second that\u2026 felt like forever. Dr. Vaile: Elijah, It wasn\u2019t your fault. Elijah, I need you to realise it wasn\u2019t your fault. * [Elijah begins to tear up. Gasping noises and shallow breathes can be heard coming from him.] Elijah: It was my fault. I didn\u2019t\u2026 I remember now. After that, when I woke up and saw what had happened it froze\u2026 it all froze. That\u2026 [Elijah motions his hand over his chest.] That pang in my heart started. I don\u2019t remember how I got home. I don\u2019t remember what I did for\u2026 what feels like a lifetime after. Dr. Vaile: You shut yourself off, is this when it started? The illness? Elijah: I think so. I remember the colour draining out of everything. That much I can put together. I didn\u2019t want to do anything. I wanted to forget, I think. I don\u2019t know why, I should have remembered. I think\u2026 I think I missed her funeral. I don\u2019t remember going. I shut it all out and\u2026 I lost the chance to remember her. Dr. Vaile: I know this is hard for you Elijah. I know you\u2019ve been holding this in for a long time. But I also know how strong you are, Elijah. You can confront this, it wasn\u2019t your fault. [Elijah begins to laugh, while still crying heavily.] Elijah: God dammit. What I would give, right now to feel numb. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t stop this pain. It was easier to\u2026 it was easier to forget. It\u2026 [Stammering through heavy inhales can be heard.] hurts and I can\u2019t shut it out. Dr. Vaile: Don\u2019t try to shut it out again, Elijah. You are strong, you can face this. You can remember, and keep remembering. Don\u2019t forget Laura, she wouldn\u2019t want you to forget her, would she Elijah? Elijah: No, no she wouldn\u2019t. That smile\u2026 is the last time I saw her alive. I made a mistake and\u2026 Do you think she would forgive me? If she was looking down on me right now, could she forgive me? Dr. Vaile: I think so, Elijah. I also think, you can forgive yourself. I think you did great today. Elijah: I think I need to be alone for a bit. I need time to\u2026think. Dr. Vaile: I understand. I\u2019m glad you were able to remember her, Elijah. I think this is a great step towards overcoming this illness. Elijah: I hope so. [Elijah spent a few minutes composing himself before leaving the office.] <End Log> +\u00a0Open\u00a0continuation\u00a0of\u00a0treatment -\u00a0Close\u00a0continuation\u00a0of\u00a0treatment The treatment for SCP-3234 in Elijah has so far been a success. After our breakthrough in session four, I was able to get Elijah to open up further. The sessions directly following have shown Elijah to be in a significantly better mental state than at the beginning of treatment. It is my suggestion that Elijah be considered for return to the general population. A Class-A amnestic should be administered. The cover story should be significant therapy sessions about the traumatic experience he had been through that caused disassociation and depression within Elijah. An agent is to be placed in Elijah\u2019s life to act as a friend, to help lessen the chance of a possible relapse. It\u2019s currently believed that Elijah is in complete remission from SCP-3234\u2019s effects and should not be deemed a threat. \u2013Dr. Vaile",
